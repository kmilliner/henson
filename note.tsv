The Restoration religious settlement resulted during 1662 in perhaps 2,500 ministers leaving the Church rather than accept the Act of Uniformity and subscription to the BCP - the origin of protestant 'nonconformity'. Henson's allusion to a new Oxford movement expressed a hope that anglo-catholics, heirs of the original Oxford Movement, would be prevented from creating similar damage, by dividing the Church and obstructing reunion among the protestant churches.
