         <p>I revised my sermon before breakfast, &amp; then went across to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> to fetch my scarf.</p>
         <p>The <persName xml:id="1023">Lord Mayor</persName> attended the service in the Abbey. There was a very large congregation, but the offertory was but little more than &#x00A3;57. for Waifs and Strays. More than a hundred persons stayed to Communion. I <ref xml:id="430">preached</ref> on David's Census, which was the burden of the 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi>  lesson, and adapted it to an appeal for the Outcasts.  <hi rend="bold underline">In the afternoon, <persName xml:id="114">Welldon</persName> preached an extemporaneous Oration, as I judge, &amp; therefore incoherent, verbose, and badly 'topical'. It was hard to believe one was listening to an ex&#8211;Headmaster of Harrow</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi>  There was a crowded congregation in the nave at 7 p.m.  I <ref xml:id="588">preached</ref> for 40 minutes on Psalm Vlll.3&#8211;5, making in the course of my sermon some answer to <persName xml:id="1189">Frederick Harrison's</persName> <ref xml:id="161">"Creed of a Layman".</ref></p>
         <p><persName xml:id="1162">George Mackarness</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="888" display="no">Anthony Browne</persName> came in to supper.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="216">Gow</persName> undertook the preaching in S. Margaret's. </p>
