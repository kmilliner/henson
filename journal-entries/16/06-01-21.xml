         <p>A wet cold morning ushering in a day, sunless, chilly, &amp; with frequent showers. I celebrated at 8 a.m: there were 28 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>. At 10 a.m. the Bishop of London preached in the Abbey: and I ascribed to this cause the absenteeism of many familiar faces from my congregation in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>. However a congregation of a sort assembled, and I preached rather over their heads from S. Matt: xii.48&#8211;50. The Offertory was just under &#x00A3;11.</p>
         <p>The day grew worse as it drew towards night&#8211;fall: and at Evensong it was wet enough to spoil the congregation.  I preached on Romans xii. 9&#8211;10 "Let love be without hypocrisy &amp;c.".  After Church, who should be awaiting me but <persName xml:id="971">Dick Hedger</persName> and <persName xml:id="972" display="no">his wife</persName>?  They had attended the service, &amp; seemed happy &amp; hopeful.  </p>
