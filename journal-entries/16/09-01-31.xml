         <p>A fine but bitterly cold morning. I celebrated in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Marg<hi rend="superscript underline">t's</hi> at 8 a.m. when there were but 14 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.  <persName xml:id="112">My wife</persName> was in <hi rend="italic">Cambridge week&#8211;ending with <persName xml:id="1209">Kitty Inge</persName>. <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> &amp; I had immense conversations. That young man promises to 'make history' in rather a surprising fashion.</hi> 
         </p>
         <p>At Mattins there was a larger congregation than I had expected, &amp; it was more virile than usual.  Especially noticeable were the white &amp; grey heads.  What does this signify?  <hi rend="bold underline">Is my teaching obsolete, &amp; therefore attractive to the old?</hi>  Most commonly the presence of <hi rend="underline">young men</hi> is said to be the mark of a great or successful preacher.  <persName xml:id="392">Campbell's</persName> congregation at the <orgName xml:id="37">City Temple</orgName> is mainly youths &amp; young men.  Is that really a satisfactory indication of the character of his preaching?  <hi rend="bold underline">I am disposed to explain the influx of ancients into <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> by the breaking&#8211;up of two congregations &#8211; <persName xml:id="103">Ainger's</persName> at the Temple, &amp; <persName xml:id="1332">Page&#8211;Roberts's</persName> at Vere Street. In neither case has the new preacher been equal to his place.</hi>  The Offertory slightly exceeded &#x00A3;12.</p>
         <p>At Evensong there was a fair congregation. I preached on 'Spiritual Relationship to Christ'. The offertory: &#x00A3;5.12.0.</p>
