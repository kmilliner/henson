         <p><persName xml:id="55">Knox</persName> celebrated at 8 a.m. &amp; I assisted. There were 17 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>Mattins, Litany, Commination Service, Sermon, &amp; Holy Communion, interspersed with five hymns, took exactly two hours. We went in on the stroke of 11 a.m., and came out on the stroke of 1 p.m. I preached an old sermon on 'Herod Antipas, as a wrongly&#8211;conscientious man': I also Celebrated; there were 20 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">Between services I wrote to <persName xml:id="1608">Bishop Mann</persName>.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The service at 8 p.m. had to be cancelled on account of the "Suffragettes" who renewed their attempt to force an entrance into the House. <persName xml:id="1795">Lady Constance Lytton</persName> among others was arrested.</p>
         <p>Later <persName xml:id="413">Harry Reichel</persName> arrived with an immense cold on him.</p>
         <p>I bought a copy of <persName xml:id="1796" display="no">Wilkins</persName>' <ref xml:id="197">Concilia</ref> for &#x00A3;20. One of the four volumes was Lamp&#8211;stained.</p>
