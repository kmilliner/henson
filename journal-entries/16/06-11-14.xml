         <p>This is <persName xml:id="77">Marion's</persName> birthday. May God bless the best sister in the world!</p>
         <p>I wasted the forenoon in Convocation, where, in default of anything to do, we killed time with futile discussions about the propriety of special prayers for Convocation during its session, and the desirableness of spending less money in the organizing missions. Ten of the reverend fathers came to lunch.</p>

<hi rend="italic bold underline">I fell in with <persName xml:id="49">Gore</persName> as I set out for my constitutional, and walked with him as far as Lambeth. It is the case, strange though it must appear since we go so widely adrift on all public questions, that whenever I meet Gore face to face, I feel all mine ancient affection for him renewed into life.</hi>
