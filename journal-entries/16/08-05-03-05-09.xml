         <p><persName xml:id="55">Knox</persName> celebrated at 8 a.m. There were 37 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.  I assisted.  During service a deluge of rain came on, menacing us with small congregations, &amp; smaller collections. </p>
         <p><persName xml:id="427">Inge</persName> preached an admirable sermon, but there were few to hear it.</p>

         <p><orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName> sate on Tuesday, &amp; Wednesday (May 5, 6) and the <orgName xml:id="58" display="no">Representative Church Council</orgName> on Thursday &amp; Friday (May 7, 8). I spoke twice in the <listEvent><event xml:id="83">former</event></listEvent>, &amp; once in the <listEvent><event xml:id="84">latter</event></listEvent>. Education &amp; the Licensing Bill were discussed in both assemblies. The by&#8211;elections have stirred up a most fanatical spirit: 'no compromise' is the policy which stirs enthusiasm. The Episcopal Bench was on both questions in a minority. On both I voted with them.</p>
