         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m. There were 23 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>At Mattins I preached the first sermon of a course on 'Discipline'. There was a better congregation than I expected, since the <persName xml:id="166">Bp. of London</persName> was preaching in the <orgName xml:id="59" display="no">Chapel Royal</orgName>: and <persName xml:id="1124">Canon Bigg</persName> at the Abbey.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I went with <persName xml:id="554">Gilbert</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="630">Robert</persName> to the Grafton Square Congregational Church at Clapham, and <listEvent><event xml:id="50">spoke</event></listEvent> for 3/4 an hour on 'Fasting' to about 1200 men.  They were very attentive, although my line of thought must have been both unpalatable &amp; unfamiliar.  I was impressed by the <hi rend="underline">senior</hi> aspect of the audience.  Bald heads &amp; grey hair seemed the rule.</p>
         <p>At Evensong I preached again in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>. There was a large &amp; very attentive congregation. The sermon was the first of a series on "The Ten Commandments".</p>
