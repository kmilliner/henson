         <p>A beautiful bright morning. I celebrated at 8 a.m. There were 54 communicants.</p>
         <p>At Mattins the congregation was disappointing. Perhaps the <persName xml:id="166">Bishop of London</persName> at the <orgName xml:id="59" display="no">Chapel Royal</orgName> drew off the members. In any case, there was but a poor show in the Parliamentary Seats. <persName xml:id="193">Lord S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Aldyn</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1001">his wife</persName> were in the Speaker's Seat: &amp; <persName xml:id="368">Victor Cavendish</persName>: besides these I recognised no others.  <persName xml:id="456">Blackmore</persName> celebrated after Mattins: there were 79 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>; making a total of 133 for the day.</p>
         <p>After lunch I went to Bethnal Green, and preached to a considerable company of men in Watts&#8211;Ditchfield's Church. The <persName xml:id="128">Abp. of Canterbury</persName> was preaching in the <placeName xml:id="8">Excelsior Hall</placeName> hard by.</p>
         <p>At Evensong there was a large congregation but a small collection. I preached on "Christian Preaching": and, after the service, spoke on "Personal Religion".</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="759">Lord Lytton</persName> came to see me at 9 p.m. &amp; talked over Education for an hour.</p>
