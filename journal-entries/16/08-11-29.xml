         <p><persName xml:id="55">Knox</persName> celebrated at 8 a.m: I assisted. There were 26 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>. At 11 a.m. the congregation was but moderate in number: <persName xml:id="1731">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Lowther</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1895">her daughter</persName>, <persName xml:id="193">Lord</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1001">Lady S. Aldwyn</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="633">Sir Henry Graham</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="747" display="no">Captain Butler</persName> were all I could recognise in the members' seats.  I preached from the 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> lesson:&#8211; <hi rend="underline">'Ye were as sheep going astray, but are now returned to the Shepherd &amp; Bishop of your souls.'</hi>  Afterwards I celebrated the Holy Communion.  There were 78 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="826">Ernest Bennett</persName></hi> accompanied me to the <orgName xml:id="65">Leysian Mission</orgName>, where I <listEvent><event xml:id="68">addressed</event></listEvent> the 'Monster Men's Meeting'.  There were perhaps 1000 men present, all of the poorer sort of artisan. They listened very nicely to what must have seemed rather a dull disquisition, &amp; were very emphatic in their applause when I had finished.</p>
         <p>I preached again in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at Evensong. The congregation was disappointingly small.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="1893" display="no">Stock</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1894" display="no">Pritchard</persName>, two of the three young men who came to me by night some weeks since, came to supper. The former is a very agreeable young fellow.</p>
