He told me that he hoped to secure Biblical Instruction in all the schools at the option of the local authorities; that in the non&#8211;provided schools which were taken over, whether by lease or purchase, facilities for denominational teaching might be given: &amp; possibly (though the teachers would probably resent this) over the whole area.  He would be ready to make a special arrangement for the Roman, Jewish, &amp; possibly also the Anglican schools in the towns.</hi>
