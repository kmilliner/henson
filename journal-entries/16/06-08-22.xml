         <p>A most persistently wet day. I rashly proposed the ascent of 'Black Andrew', and <persName xml:id="1062" display="no">Miss Lang</persName> valourously elected to join me. We ascended the hill, and, cheated by a brief improvement of the weather, resolved to return home by a longer route which would have given us a view of <placeName xml:id="23" display="no">Bowhill</placeName>, the residence of the <persName xml:id="125">Duke of Buccleugh</persName>. But we had not gone above a mile or so before we ran into a grouse&#8211;driving party, by whose advice we took shelter on the hill&#8211;side. Tiring of this damp vigil &#8211; for the rain resumed in earnest &#8211; we set caution at defiance and returned on our steps to Broadmeadows, where we arrived in a wet and draggled state, having put up a good many grouse and black&#8211;cock on the way. Then change, hot bath and a belated lunch.</p>
