         <p><persName xml:id="427">Inge</persName> preached a brilliant &amp; most excellent sermon in the Abbey at 10 a.m. on "Command that these stones be made bread". It was a courageous plea for the old Christian doctrine that a man's primary duty is to save his own soul.</p>
         <p>There were no less than 110 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="41">Harry Davis</persName> came to lunch.</p>
         <p>There was a very large congregation in the Abbey at 3 p.m. I preached on <ref xml:id="418">"The failure of Tradition"</ref>, taking my text from the 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> lesson: "making the Word of God void through your tradition".  <persName xml:id="1211">George Russell</persName> was in church.  He sent me a note to say that he agreed with the sermon!!!.  <hi rend="bold underline">Yet I do grievously suspect that he wrote the scurrilous <ref xml:id="203" display="no">article</ref> in the current issue of the "Church Times".</hi>
         </p>
         <p><persName xml:id="1210">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Rutty</persName>, late headmaster of Leatherhead School, preached in the Abbey at 7 p.m.  His sermon was crudely orthodox: but he was evidently sincere, &amp; he belonged to a past generation.  So I civilly entreated him; gave him supper; &amp; sent him home with pleasant words.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="1208">Gilbert Box</persName> came to supper: a nice boy. My <persName xml:id="7">godson</persName>, <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName>, <persName xml:id="1019">Addis</persName>, <persName xml:id="1204">Mary</persName>, Inge, &amp; <persName xml:id="1209">his wife</persName> made up our party at supper.</p>
