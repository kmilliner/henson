         <p>I celebrated in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m. There were but 9 communicants.</p>
         <p>Having deposited the Preacher, <persName xml:id="900">White</persName>, in the <placeName xml:id="10">Jerusalem Chamber</placeName> with the <persName xml:id="44">Dean</persName>, I went to S. Margaret's and read Mattins &amp; Litany. <persName xml:id="216">Gow</persName> preached an excellent discourse on "Maranatha". The congregation, however, was lamentably small, for the Christmas stampede has this year been of exceptional magnitude.</p>
         <p>At Evensong in the Abbey there was a great gathering of 'country cousins'. Under the circumstances they were well behaved, &amp; listened to the Sermon, (somewhat shortened for their benefit) with tolerable attention. My text was Isaiah 33.17. "Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty: they shall behold a far stretching land".</p>
         <p>In S. Margaret's there was a good congregation at 7 p.m. I preached about Holy Communion, being much molested by coughing throughout my sermon. After the Benediction we sang carols; &amp; finally arranged the Communion rail against the morrow.</p>
