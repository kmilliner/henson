         <p>A close, warm day but overcast with clouds. I celebrated in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m., when there were but 19 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>, including <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName> &amp; <hi rend="bold underline">the one&#8211;armed <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName></hi>.</p>
         <p>At Mattins, the Choir being absent, their places were taken by volunteers of both sexes, whom <persName xml:id="156">Fedarb</persName> had recruited. The ladies sat on chairs in the floor of the nave, hard by the pulpit: the men were in the Choir&#8211;stalls. They managed the chants &amp; hymns very creditably, &amp; we dispersed with the anthem. I preached to a curiously 'strange' congregation on 'Holidays'. The only politician whom I recognised was <persName xml:id="253">Sir H. Fowler</persName>.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">An American clergyman, the <persName xml:id="1200" display="no">Rev. Milo Gates</persName>, of New York came to lunch with <persName xml:id="1201" display="no">his wife</persName></hi>: also <persName xml:id="898">Peile</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="571">Geordie</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1255">Signorina</persName>. I attended service at 3 in the Abbey &amp; heard Peile preach. There was a moderate congregation in S. Margaret's at Evensong: I preached on the 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> lesson &#8211; the old prophet &amp; his victim.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="1160" display="no">Miss Cockerell</persName> came to supper.</p>

         <p><hi rend="italic">On Monday, the 5</hi><hi rend="i superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="italic"> of August 1907, the day was yet young when a telegram from <persName xml:id="413">Reichel</persName> told me </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">that <persName xml:id="39">Doyle</persName> died yesterday morning, and asked me to tell the <persName xml:id="228">Warden</persName></hi><hi rend="italic">. So I sent a telegram to <orgName xml:id="225">Pusey</orgName>, and a note to the House of Commons.</hi>
         </p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">The latter caught the Warden, &amp; brought him across in the afternoon. He plainly feels Doyle's loss deeply: &amp; so do I, for he had shown me much kindness ever since the days of November 1884, when I first encountered him at All Souls. We have always maintained a friendship, which though never intimate, might at any moment have become so, and was always affectionate. His death following so closely on <persName xml:id="460">Rutherford's</persName> makes my life very consciously an emptier thing.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>On Tuesday, <persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="601">Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie</persName> dined here.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">On Wednesday, I was much in the <placeName xml:id="28">Triforium</placeName>, anent the Vacuum Cleaner which has been set to work there. <persName xml:id="752">Barnett</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName> dined here, &amp; we arranged an inspection of the Triforium on the following day. Then we spent most part of the morning there, &amp; decided to attempt large clearances of ancient rubbish.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">On Friday, I met <persName xml:id="1202">Lethaby</persName> in the Triforium, &amp; spent 2 hours with him in going carefully over whatever therein has accumulated. We agreed on much.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>In the afternoon I shewed a party of foreign delegates over the Abbey. Signorina interpreted.</p>
