         <p>I helped <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> to dress, and sent him to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m.: but took no part in the service there myself, as I have to celebrate in the Abbey at 10 a.m.</p>
         <p>There were very large congregations at 10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 7 p.m. <persName xml:id="752">Barnett</persName> preached well for the Children's Country Holiday Fund. I pleaded the same cause as best I could. The result of all was about &#x00A3;80.</p>
         <p>The <persName xml:id="1361">Bishop of Clogher</persName> preached at 7 p.m.: &amp; afterwards came in to supper.</p>
         <p>An American clergyman &#8211; <persName xml:id="1362" display="no">Taylor</persName> &#8211; of New York came in to tea after service in the afternoon.  He brought letters of introduction from the <persName xml:id="1363">Bishop of Washington</persName>. </p>

         <p>I went to the House of Lords, &amp; heard the first part of the Debate on the Scotch Land Bill.  It was introduced by the <persName xml:id="1364">Lord Chancellor</persName> in an able &amp; persuasive but largely irrelevant speech.  <persName xml:id="1183">Lord Balfour of Burleigh</persName> opposed with vigour in a long &amp; able speech, in which he certainly displayed complete mastery of the subject.  <hi rend="italic">For the Government, <persName xml:id="1281">Lord Tweedmouth</persName> twaddled helplessly, </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">and was followed by <persName xml:id="292">Lord Rosebery</persName>, whose speech will be long remembered. I was not a little surprised by the violence of his gestures</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>On the 12<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Sunday after Trinity, August 18<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1907, <persName xml:id="427">Inge</persName> preached excellently at 10 a.m.: I preached an old sermon on 'Christian Marriage' at 3 p.m.: and a Six&#8211;Preacher of Canterbury ranted at 7 p.m.  <persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName> was in church both in the afternoon &amp; in the evening, &amp; came in to supper. </p>
