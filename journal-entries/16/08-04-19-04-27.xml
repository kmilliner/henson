<hi rend="bold">Easter Day, April 19</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1908.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A bitterly cold day with alternations of sunshine &amp; snow&#8211;storms!  The statue of Lord Beaconsfield in Parliament Square was elaborately adorned with primroses, and probably assisted to attract the huge congregation, which came together at 11 a.m.  The communicants numbered <hi rend="bold">351 </hi>distributed thus:&#8211;</p>
         <p>At 7 a.m. 41: at 8 a.m. 115: at 11 a.m. 195. This is 40 more than last year, and 20 more than the year before that. The numbers never seem to have recovered the last General Election.</p>
         <p>In 1902 there were 380.</p>
         <p>" 1903 " " 382.</p>
         <p>" 1904 " " 387.</p>
         <p>" 1905 " " 395.</p>

         <p>" 1907 " " 311.</p>
         <p>" 1908 " " 351.</p>
         <p>The weather steadily (or rather <hi rend="underline">unsteadily</hi>) worsened as the evening drew on: the congregation at Evensong was large, but not equal to former years. I preached on the Worship of Christ.</p>

         <p>All these particulars were sent again (together with a mildly expostulatory letter) on 15<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> of Sept. 1908 to M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> James Reith, Surveyor of Taxes, 54 Parl<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Street, S.W.</p>

         <p>On Easter Sunday, April 20, 1908, <persName xml:id="584">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Dennistoun</persName> carried me in his motor car to Cheltenham, stopping at Oxford on the way, there being entertained at luncheon in All Souls by <persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName>.  <persName xml:id="355">Fletcher</persName> was of the party.  I was received as a guest at Balcarras House, Charlton Kings, which is a suburb of Cheltenham, by Major&#8211;General Smith &amp; his family.  The weather was utterly odious &#8211; snow, blizzards, hurricanes, rain.  But we managed to see Fairford, Daglingshurst, Tewkesbury, Deerhurst, and Bibury.</p>
         <p>Deerhurst is the only church now surviving, in which the chancel is arrange<hi rend="b subscript">^</hi>d<hi rend="b subscript">^</hi> for reception of the Sacrament, in the Presbyterian fashion.  There is an 11<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century Saxon chapel in a farm&#8211;house, recently identified.</p>
         <p>On Friday I returned to Westminster, &amp; went on the same day to Birchington where I remained until Thursday the 30<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> April, being entertained by <persName xml:id="76">Mother</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="77">Marion.</persName></p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">I came up to the Abbey on Monday, the 27</hi>

<hi rend="italic bold underline">M. Clemenceau, the French Premier, attended. It was observed that he had a curious resemblance to C.B.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The weather suddenly became almost oppressively warm. "The Heat&#8211;wave" replaced on the paper&#8211;boards the 'April Snowstorms' of last week.</p>
