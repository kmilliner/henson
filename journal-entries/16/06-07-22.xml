         <p>The heat during the night was excessive, and hindered sleep, so that I reach the day already exhausted.</p>
         <p>There were 26 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at 8 a.m.</p>

In the course of the morning sermon I made some allusion to the death of <persName xml:id="1037">Lady Curzon</persName>. The congregations were not large, but considering the lateness of the date &#8211; the "season" being practically ended &#8211; as large as I expected. After Mattins a collection was made at the doors for the new cricket field at Ilford, and realized over &#x00A3;18.</p>
