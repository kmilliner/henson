         </p>
         <p>I celebrated in S. Marg<hi rend="superscript underline">t's</hi> at 8 a.m.  There were 19 cts. including <persName xml:id="1107">Carr&#8211;Gomm</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1108">his wife</persName>, whom I do not remember to have seen at Communion before.</p>
         <p>The <persName xml:id="296">Sub. Dean</persName> preached for me at 11 a.m. I went with the <persName xml:id="378">Dean of S.Alban's</persName> to the Abbey. The said Dean preached an excellent sermon on the words "<hi rend="underline">Study to be quiet.</hi>'</p>
         <p>At 3 p.m. there was a very large congregation. I preached on 'The Social duty of the Christian man', taking some words from the parable of Dives &amp; Lazarus for my text. This was as near as I felt myself free in conscience to go towards responding to the <orgName xml:id="110">C.S.U.</orgName> circular, signed by the <persName xml:id="44">Dean</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="752">Barnett</persName> with others, which had appointed this Sunday to be 'Citizen Sunday', and suggested as the themes for preaching, 'sweating' and 'the living wage'.</p>
         <p>At 7 p.m. there was another crowd in the Abbey.  I preached on 'Dives &amp; Lazarus.'  <hi rend="bold underline">In the congregation was the <persName xml:id="215">Prime Minister</persName></hi>. Probably he expected something about the Unemployed: but I have nothing useful to say on that subject: nor do I think the fashion of 'topical' preaching is really serviceable to anybody.</p>

         <p>On Tuesday, the 27<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Oct, through a heavy rain I travelled to Nottingham from S. Pancras by the 4.55 express, which arrived punctually to time, at 7.19.  Here mine host <persName xml:id="1975">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Thornton</persName> met me, &amp; we went to his house going at once to our rooms to dress for dinner.  Four persons arrived to dine, all interesting.  <persName xml:id="1976">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Russell</persName>, a son of <persName xml:id="1977">Lord Charles Russell</persName>, who was Sergeant at Arms, &amp; brother to <persName xml:id="1978">Lord John</persName>; &amp; <persName xml:id="1979" display="no">his daughter</persName>: <persName xml:id="1980"><hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Wilde</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> &amp; <persName xml:id="1981">his wife</persName>.  She was a daughter of <persName xml:id="1982">Severn</persName>, the painter, &amp; herself is no mean artist.</hi>  M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Russell has great reputation as a raconteur, but he grows deaf: &amp; I did not get much conversation out of him.  Later, when the guests had departed, <persName xml:id="1983">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Claude Thornton</persName>, the son of mine host, a young clergyman working in a mining parish near to the city arrived.</p>
         <p>On Wednesday, the 28<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Oct. the weather had greatly improved. After breakfast mine host took me to the Hospital, where the Matron escorted us over several of the wards, &amp; showed us the chapel &amp; the operating room. Then we went to S. Mary's, a splendid church, where the annual service was held. The <persName xml:id="1991" display="no">Mayor</persName> &amp; Corporation attended, &amp; the Governing Body of the Hospital, together with a considerable congregation of the townsfolk. I <listEvent><event xml:id="66">preached</event></listEvent> from the words, "We must work the works of Him that sent Me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work". After service I attended the Governours' [sic] meeting in the County Hall, where <persName xml:id="1992">Lord Manvers</persName> moved &amp; <persName xml:id="1985">Sir Joseph Bright</persName> seconded a vote of thanks to me for my sermon.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[377]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Then <persName xml:id="1984">Sir Charles Seely</persName> motored me to M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Thornton's house, where we lunched.  After lunch, mine host motored me to <hi rend="underline">Southwell</hi>, about 15 miles distant. Here we visited the Minster, a most noble church with a fine Norman nave, &amp; a Chapter House which is adorned with the loveliest Early English stone&#8211;carving in the world. <persName xml:id="1987">Archbishop Sandys</persName> has a fine monument in the northern transept, and <persName xml:id="476">Bishop Ridding</persName> is commemorated by rather a pretentious monument in the Choir. As service was beginning, we had to content ourselves with a hasty glance. Next to the Minster stands the new palace of the <persName xml:id="111">Bishop of Southwell</persName>, which has been patched up out of the ruins of an ancient palace of the Archbishops of York. The ancient hall remains intact. The late <persName xml:id="1988">Bishop Trollope</persName>, Suffragan of Lincoln, restored this, &amp; adorned it with paintings of <persName xml:id="1439">Jeremy Taylor</persName>, <persName xml:id="1989">Bishop Sanderson</persName>, <persName xml:id="1990" display="no">Archbishop Wolsey</persName>, <persName xml:id="1838">Cranmer</persName>, &amp; Sandys, &amp; some others. We were hospitably entertained at tea by <persName xml:id="1986">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Hoskyns</persName>, the Bishop's wife. Then we motored home in the failing daylight, arriving about 6 p.m.</p>
         <p>At 8 p.m. the Church was about half&#8211;full.  I <listEvent><event xml:id="77">preached</event></listEvent> for 35 minutes from the words "Freely ye received: freely give".  The sermon was not popular in form or matter, but the congregation, mostly composed of artisans, listened with very close attention.  Then back to mine host's, where <term xml:id="33">tea&#8211;bibbing</term> <hi rend="underline">recklessly</hi>, &amp; so to bed shortly before 11 p.m.</p>

         <p>[Family tree showing descendants of Duke of Bedford: Duke of Bedford, Lord John, created Earl Russell, Lord Charles Russell Sergeant at Arms. Descendants of Charles Russell: Rev. C. Russell, R<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Hon: George R.]</p>
         <p>This appears to be the relationship of the redoubtable <persName xml:id="1211">George R.</persName> The talkative old gentleman I met last night is his elder brother. Clearly story&#8211;telling runs in that branch of the family. Mine host, Thornton, is the descendant of the <persName xml:id="1993">Clapham sectary</persName>, whose plump countenance adorns the dining room. He has been twice married. 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> to a <persName xml:id="1994">Miss Grenfell</persName> (sister of the <persName xml:id="1995">General</persName>,) by whom he has a family of five sons &amp; several daughters.  2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> to a <persName xml:id="1996">Miss Walter</persName>, who is niece to old <persName xml:id="1997">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Erskine</persName>.  He is hardly yet out of the honey&#8211;mooning stage.  Of the sons, one is a <persName xml:id="1983">clergyman</persName>; another is about to be <persName xml:id="2000">ordained</persName>: a third is a <persName xml:id="1998">Lieutenant</persName> in the Artillery &amp; is now in India: a fourth is in the <persName xml:id="2001">'business'</persName>, which I think is banking: the fifth is (I think) in the <persName xml:id="2002">Navy</persName>.  One of the <persName xml:id="1999">daughters</persName> is married to a <persName xml:id="2004">son</persName> of <persName xml:id="1984">Sir Charles Seely</persName>; she is sister to <persName xml:id="2005">Col. Seely</persName>, who holds a minor office in the Gov<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi>.
