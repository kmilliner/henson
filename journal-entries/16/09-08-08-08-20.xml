         <p>A most glorious morning. Our conversation at breakfast turned on the Roman Catholic clergy. <persName xml:id="1019">Addis</persName> said that it was an understood thing that the 'black sheep' were shipped to America.</p>
         <p>I celebrated in the Abbey. <persName xml:id="62">Kirshbaum</persName> preached an excellent sermon.</p>
         <p>At 3 p.m. there was a considerable concourse of holiday&#8211;makers. I preached an ancient sermon on 'Youth'. <persName xml:id="1797">Prof: Perry</persName> and his family came to tea. They were fellow&#8211;passengers in the 'Empress of Ireland'.</p>
         <p>At 7 p.m. I listened to a typical oration from one of the curates of S. John&#8211;the&#8211;Evangelist, Kennington.</p>
