         </p>
         <p>I wrote letters to <persName xml:id="222">Albert</persName>, <persName xml:id="62">Kirshbaum</persName>, &amp; the <persName xml:id="560">Admiral</persName>, &amp; received one (brief &amp; curt as an orderly's report) from Kirshbaum.  The "Times‚Äù of yesterday arrived with an account of the second reading division on the Education Bill on Thursday night.  The Irish voted with the Opposition, and yet the Government had a majority of 204. </p>
         <p>In the afternoon we went by steamer to Lausanne, where we had tea &amp; viewed the city. The cathedral, nobly placed on the mountain side, is a fine 13<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century church, <hi rend="bold underline">which looks rather forlorn in the service of the Calvinists.</hi>  There are some fine 16<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century stalls to be seen. We were impressed by the powerful &amp; effective engine used by the corporation of Lausanne for watering the roads. It is a locomotive driven by electricity, &amp; taking the whole width of the road in its range.</p>
