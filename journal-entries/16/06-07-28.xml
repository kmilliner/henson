         <p>I finished a sermon for tomorrow.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName> and I attended <persName xml:id="830">Lord Cheylesmore's</persName> Garden Party at <placeName xml:id="22">Hughenden Manor</placeName>, High Wycombe. A special train conveyed the guests from Paddington.</p>
         <p>Returning earlier than the rest of the company, we travelled home in the company of a <hi rend="italic">military gentleman whose name I think was <persName xml:id="1051">Hills&#8211;Johnes</persName>.  He asked me who was to be the next bishop of Truro, and when I replied that I had not so much as heard a rumour, </hi>
<hi rend="italic bold underline">he said that he had learned from 'a prominent person in the Midlands, who ought to know' that I was the man!!</hi>
<hi rend="italic">  Of course I scouted the notion, but it makes me all the more anxious that the new bishop should be appointed without delay, since in the interval my name is bandied about as if I also were 'hungry' for promotion.</hi>
