         <p>[symbol]</p>
         <p>At the <persName xml:id="1135">Moderator's</persName> breakfast I was taken in charge of by <persName xml:id="491">Lady Frances Balfour</persName>, and we talked politics with great activity &amp; ardour. I was introduced to <persName xml:id="1521">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Ross Taylor</persName>, who was the <orgName xml:id="135" display="no">U.P.</orgName> magnate responsible for the creation of the <orgName xml:id="118">U.F. Church</orgName>.  Also I had a few words with <persName xml:id="1525">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Cooper</persName>, the leader of Presbyterian 'Ritualism'.</p>
         <p>As the rain had, for a brief space, ceased, I walked down to <placeName xml:id="27">Holyrood</placeName>, &amp; renewed my memory of the Canongate. Then to the <orgName xml:id="134">Assembly</orgName>, where the morning was in great part wasted by the Colonial Delegates, who made speeches of inordinate length &amp; indifferent quality. One man &#8211; the <persName xml:id="1523" display="no">minister</persName> of the Presbyterian Church in Kingston, Jamaica &#8211; was really intolerable. Then the work of the day began when <persName xml:id="1495">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Scott</persName> moved an Overture on Re&#8211;union &amp; Co&#8211;operation.  This was seconded in an admirable speech by <persName xml:id="1524">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Norman Macleod</persName>.  <persName xml:id="1525">Professor Cooper</persName> moved an alternative overture, which was seconded by <persName xml:id="1514" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Wallace</persName>.  About 2 p.m. I was carried off to lunch by a queer old divine &#8211; <persName xml:id="1526">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Sprott</persName> &#8211; who appears to be a recognized pundit in the eccles<hi rend="superscript underline">l</hi> history of the country.  On returning to the Assembly I found the debate still in progress.  Excellent speeches were made by <persName xml:id="719">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Marshall Lang</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="1183">Lord Balfour of Burleigh.</persName></p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[215] </hi>[symbol]</p>
         <p>The most brilliant &amp; effective speech was made by <persName xml:id="1527" display="no">Professor Paterson</persName> in answer to Prof. Cooper.  An interesting circumstance was the presence of <persName xml:id="1528">Bishop Campbell of Glasgow</persName>, who came in shortly before Patterson <hi rend="bold">[sic]</hi> began, &amp; listened to some plain speaking on the question of Episcopacy.  Some of the younger men made unpleasing speeches: &amp; <hi rend="bold underline">generally the younger men appear to be distinctly inferior to their seniors</hi>. When the vote was taken an immense majority voted for D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Scott: a mere handfull <hi rend="bold">[sic]</hi> supporting Prof. Cooper.  The debate was carried on at a high level, and was marked by much good speaking.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="1221">Miss Jean Bruce</persName> was in her place for the earlier part of the debate: &amp; we exchanged a few words. I pledged her to renew acquaintance in town. It is long since I met a girl who seemed so eminently worth knowing. She has the gravity of a Covenanter underlying the sweetness of a fair woman: her conversation is intelligent &amp; her manner amiable &amp; frank. Her father, Lord Balfour of B. may well be proud of her. I told him how greatly I appreciated &amp; enjoyed her company.</hi>
