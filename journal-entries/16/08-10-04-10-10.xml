<hi rend="bold">16th Sunday after Trinity, October 4</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1908.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A thick mist over everything. I celebrated in S. Marg<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at 8 a.m.  There were 30 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>At Mattins the church was well&#8211;filled. <persName xml:id="851">Walters</persName> sang the service: <persName xml:id="122">Hine&#8211;Haycock</persName> read the Lessons &amp; celebrated. I preached an old sermon. There were 66 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>In the Abbey <hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="117">Rashdall</persName></hi> was the preacher.</p>
         <p>I preached in the Abbey at 3 p.m. There was a very large congregation.</p>
         <p>At 7 p.m. <hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="624">Caldecott</persName></hi> preached well on 'Youth', but was not well&#8211;heard.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[365] </hi>[symbol]</p>
         <p>On Monday, the 5<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Oct, I was engaged most part of my spare time in preparing my paper for the <orgName xml:id="77">Church Congress</orgName>: and on Tuesday, <hi rend="bold underline">I travelled to Liverpool in order to fulfil my promise to give an <listEvent><event xml:id="63">address</event></listEvent> at <persName xml:id="401">Sir Ed. Russell's</persName> “Christian Conference”.</hi>  This I did the next morning at breakfast.  The company was mixed including several Nonconformists of diverse sects, and one Jesuit priest (<persName xml:id="1931">Father Day</persName>, a son of the <persName xml:id="1932">Judge</persName>).  My speech was civilly received, but plainly not much liked by the clerics present. It was fully reported in the <ref xml:id="254">'Liverpool Daily Post'</ref> of the following day.  After breakfast I wandered about Liverpool, visited the Picture Collection, &amp; went on the Mersey.  At dinner there were several parsons convened to meet me, including a Congregationalist Minister named <persName xml:id="1933">Sewell</persName>, the curate of the parish, <persName xml:id="1934">Wilkinson</persName>, an ex&#8211;Congregationalist, the <persName xml:id="1935">Rector of Wallasey</persName>, &amp; two more.  <hi rend="underline">On the following morning, Thursday, the 8</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="underline">, I went to Manchester, and read my <listEvent><event xml:id="64">paper</event></listEvent> on 'the Continuity of the Anglican Church' in the <placeName xml:id="35">Free Trade Hall</placeName>. It was received with many signs of resentment by the audience.</hi>  When the discussion began, <hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="1936">Lacey</persName> rushed to the platform &amp; delivered himself of a buffoon&#8211;speech, which delighted the audience, but was equally insulting to me &amp; irrelevant to my argument.</hi>  Then I joined <persName xml:id="413">Reichel</persName> &amp; we travelled together to Euston; arriving in <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName> shortly after 9 p.m.</p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>On Friday, Oct. 9<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, </hi>I worked at sermons all day: save when, during the afternoon, <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> &amp; I walked to the British Museum, and looked at the Caesars, &amp; the Assyrian relics.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic bold underline"><persName xml:id="1937">Bernard Relleen</persName> came to see me after dinner to talk about getting to work. He has grown a solid &amp; manly youth, &amp; aspires to go to Canada. So I undertook to write respecting him to </hi><persName xml:id="1043"><hi rend="italic bold underline">D</hi><hi rend="i bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline"> Bovey</hi></persName><hi rend="italic bold underline">.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>On Saturday, Oct. 10<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> sermons again, &amp; preparation of a Lecture on <hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="1938">Williams</persName></hi> for the <orgName xml:id="113" display="no">Welsh Societies</orgName>.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">At 2 p.m. I baptized <persName xml:id="1779">Eveline Daphne</persName>, <persName xml:id="810">Radcliffe's</persName> baby, in the </hi><placeName xml:id="6" display="no"><hi rend="bold underline">Henry vii</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th's</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Chapel</hi></placeName><hi rend="bold underline">.</hi>  <persName xml:id="112">My wife</persName> was godmother.</p>
         <p>At 4 p.m. I showed a horde of Dissenting S.S. Teachers over the Abbey. There were at least 70, although I had specially stipulated for no more than 25. But these sectaries are shameless &amp; faithless.</p>
         <p>Harold went with me to a Methodist Chapel in Falmouth R<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi>, where the Welsh Societies of London were holding Festival. I <listEvent><event xml:id="76">discoursed</event></listEvent> on <hi rend="underline">'Dean Williams'</hi> for 3/4 of an hour, to their exceeding content.  We returned home something after 10 p.m. </p>
