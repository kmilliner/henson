         <p>A most glorious day from start to finish.  We went to church at 10.30 a.m., &amp; heard an indifferent extempore sermon.  After service <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I walked round to the Tour de Peilz, before returning to the Hotel for lunch.  In the afternoon we went by electric railway to <hi rend="underline">Les Avants</hi>, &amp; then walked down the Gorge de Chauderon to Montreux. The meadows at Les Avants were white with narcissus: &amp; there was a tame chamois in the garden of the Hotel where we had tea. The walk down the Gorge skirted a vigorous waterfall, and was full of changing beauties. When we emerged at Montreux, we gained a splendid view of the Dent du Midi, gleaming in the western sun's rays, &amp; looking quite near. We found a train conveniently awaiting us, &amp; arrived in the Hotel in good time for dinner.</p>
