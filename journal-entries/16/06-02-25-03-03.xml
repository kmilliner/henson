         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m. when there were but 14 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>. The day was bitterly cold, though fine: and by consequence there was much coughing in church to my extreme discomfort. I preached twice, and both times to fairly large congregations, but not very profitably.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="885" display="no">Smart</persName>, <persName xml:id="121">Custard's</persName> new deputy, came in to supper. He certainly seems superior in mind &amp; interest to the most part of deputies.</p>
         <p>I determined, &amp; on the strength of my determination, I announced, that on Saturday afternoons, I would give a series of short addresses on <listEvent><event xml:id="28">"Fundamental Christianity"</event></listEvent>.  </p>
         <p>On Monday, Feb. 26<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, I went as part of the deputation from <orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName> to present the Address to the King at Buckingham Palace.<note xml:id="54" n="1"></note> It was an impressive ceremony. Then I attended a Chapter&#8211;meeting: then a committee on the Old Westminster memorial in the Bursary: then I went to 66 Oxford Terrace, and read a paper on <listEvent><event xml:id="31">"Didactic Reserve"</event></listEvent>. 21 members of <orgName xml:id="46">C.C.C.</orgName> attended, &amp; there was rather a good debate.</p>

         <p>On Saturday, March 3<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi>, 1906, at 4 p.m. I gave the first of a series of Addresses on <listEvent><event xml:id="28">"Fundamental Christianity"</event></listEvent>. The Church appeared to be quite half filled.</p>
         <p>Reporters from "The Times" &amp; "Lloyds Weekly" were present, &amp; clamoured for the MS at the close of the Lecture.</p>
