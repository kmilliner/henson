         <p>A cold, damp, dreary day from start to finish. I celebrated the Holy Communion at 8 a.m., when there were 15 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>. At 11 a.m. I went to Church again. <persName xml:id="55">Knox</persName> read Mattins &amp; Litany, and I read the Communion Service &amp; preached. There were 23 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at the 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> celebration.</p>
         <p>On Thursday, the 14<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Feb.  Convocation began its session: and on the next day, finished its business by dutifully obeying orders from above, and appointing a Committee to arrange an answer to the Letters of Business.</p>
         <p>On Thursday, <persName xml:id="1359">Miss Hicks Beach</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1360">Sir John Keane</persName> were married in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>. <persName xml:id="625">The Bishop of Oxford</persName> officiated &amp; I assisted.</p>
