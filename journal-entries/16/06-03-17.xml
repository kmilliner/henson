         <p>I wrote a <listEvent><event xml:id="23">"Golden Lecture"</event></listEvent> for next Tuesday: and walked with <persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName> as far as the London Library. After lunch I wrote letters &amp; revised my address on "The New Testament in the State schools". At 4 p.m. I delivered the Address in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> to an assembly which, considering the remarkable fineness of the day which almost compelled flight into the open air, showed no falling off in public interest. The "Times" man again carried off my MS: &amp; to a "Yorkshire Post" man, who sought for farther knowledge of my educational views, I gave a copy of my Letter on <ref xml:id="90">'Religious Education'</ref>.</p>
