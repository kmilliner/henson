         <p rend="List Paragraph">I celebrated in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m., when there were 28 cts. <persName xml:id="636">Pearce</persName> preached there at Mattins. I finished the sermon for evensong, &amp; then went round to the church, and heard most part of his discourse. He was treating of the <persName xml:id="1232">Confessor</persName>, whom a late &amp; doubtful legend makes the first founder of S. Margaret's. After service I walked some way back with him.</p>
         <p rend="List Paragraph">In the afternoon there was a large congregation. All the members of the <orgName xml:id="82" display="no">Corporation</orgName> were present save only the <persName xml:id="109">Archdeacon</persName>. My throat was out of gear so that I delivered a rather <ref xml:id="431">long sermon</ref> with more than ordinary difficulty.</p>
