         <p>In the forenoon <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I strolled for an hour: and then I wrote to <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName>. In the afternoon we decided to renew our pleasant experience of Wednesday by again achieving the "Tour de haut Lac." We stupidly failed to change steamers at Evians&#8211;les&#8211;bains, and were carried a stage on the way to Geneva. We got out at the first landing stage and walked back to Evians&#8211; les&#8211;bains by the high&#8211;road a distance of about 2â…Ÿ<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> miles.  I noticed that the vines on the French side of the lake were grown in the Italian fashion i.e. allowed to spread abroad sustained on trees.  This is far more picturesque than the severe mutilations &amp; monotonous states of the Swiss vine&#8211;yards. Our return to Vevey was marked by a most brilliant rainbow high up on the mountains.</p>
