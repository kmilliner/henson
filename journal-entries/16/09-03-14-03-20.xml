         </p>
         <p>A cold morning following a wet night: only 12 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at 8 a.m.	</p>
         <p>It was threatening rain when we went to Church at 11 a.m: and fulfilled its promise as the service proceeded. There was an unusually small congregation, &amp; the offertory fell below &#x00A3;10. Among those present were the <persName xml:id="784">Speaker</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1731">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Lowther</persName>, <persName xml:id="215">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi></persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="246">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Asquith</persName>, <persName xml:id="193">Lord</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1001">Lady S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Aldwyn</persName>, <persName xml:id="633">Sir Henry Graham</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="634">Lady Margaret</persName>. I rather suspect that they came on the chance of an allusion being made to <persName xml:id="1868">Arnold&#8211;Foster</persName>. I preached on 'the Authority of Christ'.</p>
         <p>The rain had changed to snow when I started for the Congregational Church in Clapham where I was pledged to give an <listEvent><event xml:id="82">address</event></listEvent> to the men's meeting on "Social &amp; Political Preaching". In spite of the weather about 700 or perhaps 800 men had assembled. I spoke for about 3/4 of an hour, very plainly: &amp; was well listened to, though evidently my views were unpalatable to a large section of my audience.</p>
         <p>The weather worsened steadily, &amp; at Evensong there was the smallest congregation I can remember. I preached an old sermon on the Cleansing of the Temple.</p>

         <p>On Tuesday, the 16<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> March, there was a service in S. Marg<hi rend="superscript underline">t's</hi> in connection with M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Arnold&#8211;Forster's funeral.  A considerable number of members of both parties attended.</p>
         <p>I baptized <hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="1648" display="no">Mary Marsden</persName></hi>.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="207">Goudy</persName> called on me. He seems to be quite ready to stand to his guns on the matter of the American plagiarist.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="1650">Bridget</persName> stayed behind after the Conf</hi><hi rend="i superscript underline">n</hi><hi rend="italic"> Class to talk with me.  She is in a state of spiritual unsettlement &amp; rather troubles me.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I filled up a paper of questions about <persName xml:id="222">Albert Saxton</persName>; &amp; sent it to the <persName xml:id="325">Bp. of Winchester</persName> with a letter.</p>
         <p>My <listEvent><event xml:id="151">lecture</event></listEvent> on the Lambeth Report on Reunion &amp; Intercommunion was very ill&#8211;attended. The weather may have accounted for this in part: but I think everybody is bored with the subject.</p>
         <p>On Friday, 19<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> March, as I was about to begin teaching my Conf<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi> candidates, <persName xml:id="1614">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Alcock</persName> arrived to ask me to assist in breaking to <persName xml:id="901">Lady Scott</persName> the news of her <persName xml:id="924">son's</persName> death in India.  A telegram had just come with the tidings.</p>
         <p>On Saturday, <persName xml:id="948" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Osmund&#8211;Williams</persName> came to look at the house with a view of renting it during our absence in America.</p>
