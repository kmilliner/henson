         <p>A most glorious summer day, bringing vividly to mind the Sunday at Cuddesdon just 19 years ago, when I was ordained. The anniversary finds me in extreme perplexity. All my colleagues have suddenly announced their simultaneous departure. <persName xml:id="62">Kirshbaum</persName> goes to a living: <persName xml:id="489">Sherwood</persName> to a headmastership: <persName xml:id="851">Walters</persName> follows <persName xml:id="62">Kirshbaum</persName>. The last departure astonished me. I heard it from the <persName xml:id="166">Bishop of London</persName> who stated that he (Walters) was 'most anxious to accompany K'. But when I spoke on the matter with Walters himself, he denied this point blank. He had not seen the Bp. of L.: whose authority for his statement must have been K. I cannot advise any attempt to cross the Bp's evident wish: though it is horribly inconvenient.</p>
         <p>I went to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m: and celebrated the Holy Comm<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi>. There were 31 cts. including my 3 colleagues &amp; <persName xml:id="300">Ellison</persName>.</p>
         <p>Feeling fatigued and voiceless, I did not go to church in the forenoon, there being no necessity for my doing do, as the <persName xml:id="44">Dean</persName> was in the Abbey, &amp; a special preacher (<persName xml:id="642">Carlisle</persName>) in S. Margaret's. So I remained in my room, &amp; wrote letters &amp;c. Also I finished reading <persName xml:id="947">Madame Darmesteter's</persName> charming <ref xml:id="100">life of Ernest Renan</ref>.</p>

         </p>
         <p>In the afternoon I preached in the Abbey wearily &amp; I fear ineffectively on the Gospel for Trinity Sunday. <persName xml:id="931">The Bishop of Massachusetts</persName> was in the stalls and <persName xml:id="74">Monty Bere</persName>.</p>
         <p>There was a fair congregation at Evensong in S. Margaret's. I preached on Isaiah VI. 1.8.9. Ellison read the lessons, &amp; the last part of the prayers. Afterwards he came into supper as did <persName xml:id="888" display="no">Anthony Brown</persName> &amp; the two <persName xml:id="646" display="no">brothers</persName> Sherwood.</p>

         <p>On <hi rend="underline">Tuesday, June 12</hi><hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, the erection of the new reredos was actually begun.  <persName xml:id="18">Gerald Marshall</persName> fetched away the old reredos, which I had presented to his Church.  </p>
         <p>The Bishop of Massachusetts &amp; <persName xml:id="949">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Lawrence</persName> lunched here.  Also <persName xml:id="122">Hine&#8211;Haycock</persName> &amp; the <persName xml:id="560">Admiral</persName>.</p>
         <p>I dined at the Deanery.</p>
