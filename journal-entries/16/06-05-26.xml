         <p>I travelled by the 9.20 a.m. to Wolverhampton. <persName xml:id="66">Frank</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="937">his wife</persName> were with me: &amp; at Birmingham we were joined by the <persName xml:id="938">Gatacres</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="939"><persName xml:id="940">Daveys</persName></persName>.  We had a long drive to Claverley. There in a singularly beautiful and interesting church we held a <hi rend="bold underline">Memorial Service for <persName xml:id="23">General Gatacre</persName>, </hi>who died in Abyssinia in January last, and had there been buried.<note xml:id="48" n="1"></note> I gave a short address: &amp; the whole service occupied about Â¾ of an hour. Then we travelled back to town &amp; arrived about 7 p.m.</p>
         <p>The Rectory at Claverley is a 15<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century house, very picturesque &amp; interesting.  In the church were two fonts, the one Anglo&#8211;Saxon, the other Norman, a medieval oak roof, a 15<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century screen, a 17<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century pulpit, and some early frescoes on the north wall of the nave.</p>
