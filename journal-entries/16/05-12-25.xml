         <p>I called <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> at 6.15 a.m: &amp; sent him on to open the church for the 7 o'clock service: but I did not myself go to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> before 8 a.m., when I celebrated. We read Mattins and the unmitigated Athanasian Creed at 10 a.m. (the congregation consisted of seven women and one man!). <persName xml:id="456">Blackmore</persName> sang service at 11 a.m., &amp; I preached on Rom. I. 1&#8211;3. The Communicants were 32 at 7 a.m.: 102 at 8 a.m.: 160 at 11 a.m. = 294. In the Abbey at 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. there were 275. <persName xml:id="122">Hine&#8211;Haycock</persName> came to lunch. I went to Evensong in the Abbey: where we sang carols. My <persName xml:id="584">Father in law</persName> dined here. I read a most interesting book &#8211; <persName xml:id="904">Herbert Paul's</persName> <ref xml:id="96">"Life of Froude"</ref>.</p>
         <p>On S. Stephen's Day, carols were sung at Evensong. <persName xml:id="74">Monty Bere</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="905">his wife</persName> arrived: &amp; on S. John's Day he preached an excellent little sermon in the Abbey.</p>
