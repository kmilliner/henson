         <p>I started the day with all the comfortless accompaniments of a bad cold.  However, I did not withdraw from the excursion which had been planned overnight.  We went by steamer to <hi rend="underline">Territet</hi>, then by the funicular railway to <hi rend="underline">Glion</hi>, then by the cog. railway to <hi rend="underline">Caux</hi>, where we lunched in a palatial hotel.  After lunch we rejoined the cog. railway, and mounted to the <hi rend="underline">Rochers de Naye</hi>.  The line had been cut out of the snow drifts, which in some places were as much as 12 or 14 feet deep.  Arrived at the Hotel, we had to scramble through the snow to the summit, from whence a splendid panorama of snow&#8211;covered mountains lay before us.  Then we had tea, and began our descent.  The funicular car was unable to take us all, so we walked down, &amp; succeeded in catching the steamer at <hi rend="underline">Territet</hi>, from whence we returned to <hi rend="underline">Vevey</hi> in time for dinner at 7.30 p.m.. </p>
