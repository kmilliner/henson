         <p><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went with me to the Schools, where we gave away prizes to the children. The <persName xml:id="156"><persName xml:id="560">Churchwardens</persName></persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1947" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Sturge</persName>, the <orgName xml:id="106">L.C.C.</orgName> representative on the Managing Board attended &amp; made speeches.  At 3 p.m. I attended a meeting of the <orgName xml:id="104">S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> John's Schools Trustees</orgName> to consider a proposition from the <orgName xml:id="105">Company of Spectacle&#8211;Makers</orgName>, who wish to rent the now disused building.  We were all in the dark as to the terms of the Trust on which the building is held.</p>
         <p>I wrote to <persName xml:id="433">Canon Wilson</persName> expressing my approval of his educational proposals, but confessing my scepticism as to their practicability. The psychological moment for a settlement was let slip three years ago.</p>
