         <p>It was clear and cold when I sallied forth to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> for the early service. <persName xml:id="55">Knox</persName> celebrated. There were 34 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">The Sunday newspapers report the assassination of the King of Portugal and his eldest son.</hi>  This news may possibly go some little way to explain the fewness of the members, which was the more regrettable as it was the first Sunday in session, &amp; I had prepared a <ref xml:id="594">'political'</ref> sermon. </p>
         <p>Accompanied by <persName xml:id="630">Bob Bineham</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> I went to Leytonstone, and <listEvent><event xml:id="46">lectured</event></listEvent> on 'Erastianism' in S. Andrew's. There was a fairly numerous assemblage.</p>
         <p>At Evensong the church was fairly filled. I preached an old sermon on the first lesson.</p>

         <p>On Tuesday, Feb. 4<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, the <orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName> began its session, &amp; sat for three days, during which it passed a series of rather platitudinous resolutions on Education &amp; Temperance, all at the instance of <persName xml:id="1015">Archdeacon Sandford</persName>.</p>
         <p>I made three short speeches, in one of which I gibed at the House of Laymen.</p>
         <p>The <persName xml:id="1219">Archdeacon of Leicester</persName> &amp; the <persName xml:id="1123">Bishop of Southampton</persName> stayed here: &amp; we had luncheon parties.</p>
         <p>On Thursday afternoon &amp; Friday, the <orgName xml:id="85">Sub&#8211;Com<hi rend="superscript underline">tee</hi> on Letters of Business</orgName> met, &amp; got through its report on the Minor Offices.  The <persName xml:id="212">Dean of Canterbury</persName> surpassed himself in perfidy &amp; waywardness.</p>
         <p>On Saturday, the 8<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Feb., I dined with <persName xml:id="1562" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Emmett</persName>.  There were present the <persName xml:id="266">Attorney&#8211;General</persName>, <persName xml:id="890">Masterman</persName>, <persName xml:id="8">Mason</persName>, <persName xml:id="1459">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> J. R. Green</persName>, &amp; the <persName xml:id="129"><persName xml:id="890">Mastermans</persName></persName>.  <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, being confined to her room, by something we agree to call 'influenza', could not dine.</p>
