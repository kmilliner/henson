         <p>The day was wet to start with, but soon cleared, and developed into a warm &amp; sunny day. We wrote letters and then walked in the woods. We saw a fine waterfall &#8211; the Fall of the Turret &#8211; close to the house. A fisherman pulled out fine trout from the pool below the Fall. After lunch the <persName xml:id="1076" display="no">Japanese</persName> took his departure. <persName xml:id="1077">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Glassford&#8211;Bell</persName> took us &amp; <persName xml:id="1073" display="no">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Milligan</persName> a drive to see the country.  The hills were charming.  After tea the <persName xml:id="1078" display="no">Hakes</persName> went off.  We strolled round the lake, admiring the tall bull&#8211;rushes which fringed its banks, and the numerous waterfowl which moved on its surface.</p>
