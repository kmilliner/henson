         <p>The most glorious weather still holds for the Feast: perhaps on that account the communicants are more than sixty fewer than last year. <persName xml:id="62">Kirshbaum</persName> celebrated at 7 a.m: I at 8 a.m: <persName xml:id="456">Blackmore</persName> at 11 a.m. The numbers at the several celebrations were:&#8211;</p>

         <p>In the Abbey there were 97 c<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at 8 a.m. and 235 at 10 a.m. a total of 332.</p>
         <p>There was an immense congregation in the Abbey at 3 p.m. <persName xml:id="893" display="no">Col. FitzPatrick</persName> was present hard by <persName xml:id="894">Dryden's</persName> monument where he assured me he could hear <hi rend="underline">nothing</hi> of the <ref xml:id="579">sermon</ref> save an occasional word.  The Anthem &#8211; a solo by a boy, "I know that my Redeemer liveth" was excellently heard.</p>

         <p>On Tuesday, the 17<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> April, I left Euston at 10 a.m. and travelled to Glasgow, arriving in good time for dinner.  <persName xml:id="895">The Principal</persName>, with whom I stayed, entertained the hon. <hi rend="underline">Graduands</hi> at dinner.  After which there was a Conversazione in the Bute Hall, which I attended.  The next day, Wednesday, the 18<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> April, I was duly "capped" as a D.D.<note xml:id="42" n="1"></note> In the afternoon I called on <persName xml:id="22">Ker</persName>, &amp; met his <persName xml:id="896">father</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="897" display="no">sisters</persName>: then returned to the University &amp; attended a function in which the Principal's portrait was presented to the University. He acknowledged the gift in an effective speech, delivered in a sitting posture. Finally there was a Banquet in the Bute Hall, in which I had to return thanks for the toast of the new D.Ds. Then I returned to the House, changed into ordinary clothes, &amp; came away by the night train. I had taken a sleeping berth, &amp; passed the night more comfortably than might have been expected, arriving in Euston a few minutes after 7 a.m.</p>
