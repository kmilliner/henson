         </p>
         <p>I went round to the Church Printing C<hi rend="superscript underline">y</hi>, and complained with energy of the blunder in the printed forms of Funeral Service.  <hi rend="italic bold underline">Then, I purchased a copy of the 1</hi><hi rend="i bold superscript underline">st</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline"> number of the "Tribune", a new Liberal newspaper</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi>  Then I went to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> &amp; met the <persName xml:id="560">Admiral</persName> &amp; the electricians with reference to the re&#8211;arrangements of lighting in the Chancel.</p>
         <p>After lunch, <persName xml:id="41">Harry</persName>, <persName xml:id="927" display="no">his sister</persName>, &amp; I walked into the City, and visited S. Bartholomew's, Smithfield.  Having gone on to the <orgName xml:id="37">Temple</orgName>, we arrived after closing time.  I called at the <persName xml:id="966">Master's</persName> House, and, finding him there, asked him to shew us the Church: which in the kindest manner he did, explaining with much information the fabric, &amp; taking us up to the triforium, from which an admirable prospect of the interior was gained.  We dutifully admired the monuments, adjacent the one to the other, of <persName xml:id="967">John Selden</persName> and <persName xml:id="969">Richard Hooker</persName>.  The Master said that there was an interesting account of Selden's interment in Aubrey.</p>
