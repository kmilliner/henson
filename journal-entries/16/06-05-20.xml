         <p>A chilly, clouded day which fell to raining ere its light failed.  I celebrated at 8 a.m.  There were 49 cmmts.  At Mattins there was a large congregation but very strange.  <persName xml:id="290">Charles Parker</persName> heard his own banns read.  I preached from the words, "For He is our peace".  The sermon must have taken <hi rend="italic">nearly 40 minutes in delivery</hi>. In the congregation was the <persName xml:id="931">Bishop of Massachusetts</persName>.</p>
         <p>It rained heavily as I went to church for Evensong, and the fact was reflected in the smallness of the congregation, which was little more than half its ordinary size. I preached another old sermon. The rain continued with violence as we went home.</p>
