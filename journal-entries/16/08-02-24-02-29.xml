         </p>
         <p>I went to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m. &amp; celebrated the Holy Com<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi>. There were but 5 cts.</p>
         <p>On my return to the house I found a letter from the <persName xml:id="560">Admiral</persName> bringing sad tidings.  <hi rend="bold underline">When he reached home last night he found his <persName xml:id="1275">wife</persName> lying dead on the floor</hi>. She had attended service twice &#8211; at S. Margaret's in the morning, and at the Abbey in the afternoon.</p>
         <p>Immediately after breakfast I went to see him. He bears himself bravely, but as a man should.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">On Thursday, the 27</hi><hi rend="i superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="italic"> Feb., I travelled with the Admiral to Heacham in Norfolk, the family seat of the Rolfes, and there officiated at the Funeral.  There was a large gathering of the village folk.</hi>  On the same day there was a service in S. Margaret's at which the <persName xml:id="44">Dean</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="296">Sub&#8211;Dean</persName> officiated in my stead.  It was largely attended.</p>
         <p>On Saturday, the 29<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Feb., there was a memorial service for <persName xml:id="192">Lord Selby's</persName> youngest <persName xml:id="1569">daughter</persName>, who died under very sad conditions.  A melancholy function.</p>
