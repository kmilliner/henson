         <p>There had been rain during the night, but the morning was bright. I celebrated at 8 a.m. There were 42 communicants.</p>
         <p>At Mattins there was a very large congregation. I preached from the Epistle for the day, Eph. iv.4&#8211;6, on the Unity of the Church. No less than 105 persons remained to Communion, &amp; of these an unusually large proportion appeared to be men.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="1127" display="no">Wilson</persName> came to lunch. He goes to Cambridge next Wednesday.</p>
         <p>Accompanied by <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="554">Gilbert</persName> I went to East Ham, and preached in the new Church. The service was so long, that we missed our train, &amp; did not get back to <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName> before 9.45 p. m. There we found <persName xml:id="222">Albert Saxton</persName>, &amp; his two friends awaiting us, &amp; we embarked on a theological argument which carried us nearly to midnight.</p>
