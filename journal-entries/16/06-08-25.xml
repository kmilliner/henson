         </p>
         <p>Another bright day. The country under sun light is ravishingly beautiful.</p>

Then we started for a short walk before lunch, but misjudging distances arrived Â¾ hour late for that meal. We saw both the waterfalls &#8211; Barwick and Turret. The former is an immensely long, deep&#8211;cut gulley along which, with divers romantical turns, and deep intervening pools, a considerable stream frothed &amp; foamed fiercely. The latter is the more considerable Fall. Both were in prime condition.</p>

<hi rend="italic">In the afternoon we drove through Crieff to <placeName xml:id="25">Drummond Castle</placeName>, where the <persName xml:id="843">Countess of Ancaster</persName> has just been entertaining the <persName xml:id="942">King of Spain</persName>. The situation is splendid, and the Italian gardens amazingly fine. In the old keep, which we ascended for the view, were shown various curiosities, amongst others the cast of <persName xml:id="1065" display="no">Napoleon's</persName> face taken after death.</hi>
