         <p>The young men came duly to see me, though the rain fell in torrents. Here are names and addresses:&#8211;</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="1159" display="no">W. H. Marston</persName>, 5 Oakley Crescent, Chelsea</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="1165" display="no">Arthur Watts</persName>, 3 Fitzroy Square, W.</p>
         <p>They are both about 23 years old: both have been confirmed as boys; and getting away from home have developed doubts, and deserted (or think they have deserted) religion. Both come to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>, and profess devotion to the services. Finally, both come to me as imagining I am a Daniel, able to solve doubts &amp; interpret dreams!</p>
         <p>We talked for more than an hour. The doubts are distinctly crude, and ill&#8211;realized. Of course the Old Testament; and the Christian standard of goodness. We parted with much amiability on both sides.</p>
