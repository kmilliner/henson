<hi rend="bold">Thursday, July 4</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1907.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>[symbol]</p>
         <p>At 8 a.m. I received the Holy Comm<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi> in <placeName xml:id="6" display="no">Henry VII<hi rend="superscript underline">ths</hi> Chapel</placeName>.  The <persName xml:id="128">Abp. of Canterbury</persName> celebrated for the <orgName xml:id="57">Representative Church Council</orgName>, which attended but sparsely.</p>
         <p>At 11 a.m. the Council met in the great Hall of the <placeName xml:id="13">Church House</placeName>. An hour was wasted over a motion about Church Pensions: &amp; then we came to the main business of the day. <persName xml:id="49">The Bp. of Birmingham</persName> moved and <persName xml:id="890">Masterman</persName>, the Christian Socialist M.P., seconded a resolution,</p>
         <p>That more attention sh<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> be given in the public teaching of the Church [to the exposition of the duty of the Christian to his neighbour with special reference to the moral character of the actual conditions of industrial life].</p>
         <p>Both the mover &amp; the seconder spoke with ability &amp; a taking moral fervour.</p>
         <p>I moved an Amendment to omit all words after "to the" in line 2, &amp; to substitute "obligation resting on all Christians to apply in practice the principles of the Gospel as to the duty of the Christian to his neighbour, but that care sh<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> be taken against the risk &amp; profanation involved in any partisan use of the X<hi rend="superscript underline">ian</hi> pulpit".</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[228]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I spoke for half an hour; and in the course of my speech laid down, &amp; argued the following propositions:&#8211;</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>That the clergy are not properly charged with the <hi rend="underline">direct </hi>treatment of economic &amp; social questions.</item>
            <item>That the pulpit is normally required for another purpose viz:&#8211; instruction, exposition, exhortation</item>
            <item>That there are reasons for fearing a partisan use of the Christian pulpit.</item>
            <item>That such a partisan use implies risks and profanation.</item>
         </list>
         <p>My speech was well received. We adjourned for lunch. About 18 members of the Council lunched with us.</p>
         <p>On resuming business, <persName xml:id="1318">Cunningham</persName> seconded my Amendment. He was followed by <persName xml:id="314">Lord Hugh Cecil</persName>, who spoke excellently. <persName xml:id="390">Lathbury</persName> came next on the other side. Then the <persName xml:id="475">bishops of Hereford</persName>, <persName xml:id="625">Oxford</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="105">Southwark</persName>. A laymen, <persName xml:id="1553" display="no">Brooks</persName>, spoke well; as also did <persName xml:id="126">Pryke</persName>: &amp; then <persName xml:id="49">Gore</persName> replied. Finally the resolution &amp; amendment were united in a resolution which was agreed to without a division in these terms:&#8211;</p>
         <p>That more attention should be given in the public teaching of the Church to the obligation resting on all Christians to apply in practice the Principals of the Gospel as to the duty of the Christian to his neighbour with special reference to the <hi rend="bold">[229] </hi>moral character of the actual conditions of industrial life, but that care sh<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> be taken against the risks involved in any of the partisan use of the Christian pulpit.</p>
         <p>The <persName xml:id="1554">Bp. of Salisbury</persName> proposed the omission of the word 'profanation', and I opposed: but was defeated on a show of hands.  Many congratulations were offered me on this result; and <hi rend="bold underline">I think the general impression was that I had won a victory</hi>.	 </p>
