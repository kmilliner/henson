         <p>The Archdeacon of Oxford (<persName xml:id="1447">Archer&#8211;Houblon</persName>) conferred with me on the matter referred to us (&amp; <persName xml:id="1220">Canon Bartram</persName>, who was not able to come,) viz: the provision of new rubrics regulating the use of the Burial Office. After an hour's discussion we agreed to propose the following:&#8211;</p>
         <p>The Order for the Burial of the Dead to be used for those baptized persons who have departed this life in the faith and fear of Christ.</p>
         <p>Here it is to be noted that the Office ensuing is not to be used for any that die unbaptized, or excommunicate, or in the commission of any given crime, or have laid violent hands on themselves.</p>
         <p>In the case of those who, having laid violent hands upon themselves, have been found to have been of unsound mind, the Minister may, at his discretion, use a shortened form as hereinafter provided.</p>
