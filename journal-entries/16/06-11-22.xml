         <p>The weather became suddenly warm with the consequence that I was dilapidated &amp; unworkable. In the afternoon I walked with <persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName> &amp; in the evening dined at the <placeName xml:id="29">Stationers' Hall</placeName> with the Livery Club of the <orgName xml:id="83">Company of Musicians</orgName>. I proposed the toast of the Company in a futile little speech, which, however, was well listened to. After dinner some excellent music, vocal &amp; instrumental, was provided.</p>
