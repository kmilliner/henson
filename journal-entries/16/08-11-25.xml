         <p><persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName> &amp; I walked to the <orgName xml:id="107">Literary Society's</orgName> rooms in Hanover Sq., &amp; there he delivered an admirable lecture criticizing <persName xml:id="1942">Greenwood's</persName> <ref xml:id="268">book</ref> against the "Stratfordian" theory of Shakespearian authorship.  <hi rend="underline">Greenwood</hi> himself was present, &amp; spoke after the lecture had concluded.  He struck me as a blustering, amateurish man, who had no case.</p>

<hi rend="bold underline">I dined with <persName xml:id="601">Sir Kenneth</persName>. </hi><persName xml:id="215"><hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Asquith</hi></persName>, <hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="1944">Lord Franard</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="1943">Sir Fleetwood Edwards</persName> were the rest of the party.</hi>  We had much conversation.  A: asked me suddenly, ["]What do you think of <persName xml:id="636">Pearce</persName>?  Would he do for S. Pauls?"  I sang P.'s praises.  We talked pretty frankly about affairs ecclesiastical: &amp; I pressed on him strongly the disastrous over&#8211;representation of the High Church party on the Bench.  <hi rend="bold underline">He seemed to agree: but pleaded that there were none but High Churchmen available for appointment. Happily he avoided all reference to <persName xml:id="130">Lang's</persName> preferment to York. Had he raised that matter, it had not failed that I should have given him offence.</hi>
