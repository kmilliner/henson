         <p>I did not get up for the early Communion, being still greatly dilapidated by my cold.  Only one communicant appeared, so that there was no Celebration, the Rubric being duly observed.  It was afterwards reported that the same thing had happened at S. Martin's.  <hi rend="underline">No</hi> communicants at the two principal parish churches of a City which contains over 170,000 souls, &amp; that on a Sunday morning!!  I preached at Mattins to a very small congregation: and again at Evensong: all very depressing and unhopeful.</p>
         <p>On Monday I completed the sermon for Christmas Day: and made some purchases of books as presents.</p>
