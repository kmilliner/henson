         </p>
         <p>Being still on the sick&#8211;list, I did not go to the early service: but I duly read the Commination Service, and preached at 11 a.m.</p>
         <p>That garrulous old crank, <persName xml:id="642">Sir Peile Thompson</persName>, called after service.</p>
         <p>On Thursday, the 5<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> March, we lunched at the <persName xml:id="784">Speaker's</persName>.  <persName xml:id="243">Canon Rawnsley</persName> &amp; another guest were there; &amp; <persName xml:id="1320">Mr Paul Sabatier</persName> who is over here lecturing on 'Modernism'.  He is a pleasant little old man, &amp;, tho' he spoke but French, I could mostly understand him. </p>
         <p>On Friday the 6<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> of March, I fell in with the <persName xml:id="1454">Bishop of S. Asaph</persName>; and walked with him on the way to the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName>, discussing the Education Bill.  <hi rend="bold underline">He is somewhat serpentine in aspect &amp; character</hi>, but professed to think that, tho' the Bill as it stands is impossible, a settlement will be found.</p>
