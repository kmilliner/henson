         <p rend="List Paragraph">Five years ago, on Oct. 20<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, 1902, I was married in the Abbey. How much has happened, &amp; how much has changed! I went to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m. through a half&#8211;hurricane, &amp; celebrated. There were but 14 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>. <persName xml:id="923">Newsom</persName> preached a thoughtful and pleasant sermon at Mattins. I read the lessons.</p>
         <p rend="List Paragraph">In the afternoon I <listEvent><event xml:id="39">preached</event></listEvent> in the <orgName xml:id="79">Temple Church</orgName>. There was a very fair congregation, in which I observed <persName xml:id="1365" display="no">Lyttelton</persName>.</p>
         <p rend="List Paragraph">S. Margaret's was very full, at Evensong, when I preached on 'Pride', basing my sermon on the story of Belshazzar, which was the lesson of the day.</p>

         <p>On Monday, the 21<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> Oct, the sub com<hi rend="superscript underline">tee</hi> dealing with the <orgName xml:id="81" display="no">Rubrics of Morning &amp; Evening Prayer</orgName> met in my study, after lunching with me.  They were all present viz: the <persName xml:id="285">Dean of Peterboro</persName> in the Chair: <persName xml:id="1245">Canon Deane</persName>, <persName xml:id="1212">Prebendaries Bolton</persName> and <persName xml:id="749">Villiers</persName>, and myself.</p>
         <p>On Tuesday, the 22<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> Oct, I made copies of minutes of yesterday's meeting, &amp; sent them to the members.  Then by the midnight train from Euston I travelled to Glasgow.  Having breakfasted, I went on to Bishopton, where the motor&#8211;car met me, &amp; brought me to Barochan.  Of my host, I saw but little as he was summoned to London to take part in the Conference of Railway Directors.</p>
         <p>On Thursday I went in to Glasgow, in order to <listEvent><event xml:id="40">address</event></listEvent> a meeting of the Y.M.C.A. in S. Andrew's Hall.  <hi rend="bold underline">The <ref xml:id="169" display="no">'Glasgow Herald'</ref> of that morning had printed on its front page a rather violently&#8211;worded 'protest' against my being allowed to address an assembly of young men. The writer &#8211; </hi><persName xml:id="1247"><hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Sholto Douglas</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> &#8211; adduced a series of extracts from the Hibbert Journal Article on the <ref xml:id="16">Resurrection</ref>, which I wrote at the time of the <persName xml:id="496">Beeby</persName> episode.  He is an eccentric clergyman of strongly&#8211;pronounced Evangelical opinions, who is mainly considerable as possessing great wealth, &amp; being heir to the Blythswood peerage.  As far as I could judge his 'protest' fell flat</hi>.  The Glaswegians were in no mood for a heresy hunt, &amp; <hi rend="bold">[256]</hi> [symbol] rather resented a proceeding which seemed to diminish something from the grace of their hospitality.  I lodged with <persName xml:id="1366" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> A. Lindsay</persName>, &amp; was hospitably received by <persName xml:id="1367" display="no">his wife</persName> &amp; 3 'learned ladies', <persName xml:id="1368" display="no"><persName xml:id="1369" display="no"><persName xml:id="1370" display="no">his daughters</persName></persName></persName>.  The Y.M.C.A. meeting appeared to be successful.  On Sunday, the 27<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Oct.  I was motored from Barochan to the Cathedral in Glasgow, where I <listEvent><event xml:id="41">preached</event></listEvent> to an immense congregation.  I lunched with <persName xml:id="412">Parker&#8211;Smith</persName>, and called on old <persName xml:id="1371" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Kerr</persName>; at the evening service I <listEvent><event xml:id="42">preached</event></listEvent> in the Westbourne U.F. Church to another great congregation.  <persName xml:id="712">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Adam Muir</persName> came with me, &amp; thus was provided an edifying spectacle of Eccles<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> fellowship.  On Monday, the 28<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Oct., I visited the Hostel where the theological students of the C. of Scotland reside: visited that original, <persName xml:id="1373">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Hugh Hopkins</persName> the bookseller: visited an Arts &amp; Crafts Exhibition &amp; made some purchases: lunched with the <persName xml:id="976">Lord Provost</persName> at the Town Bldgs: visited the Municipal Art Galleries which are excellent: attended a reception at the Lord Provost's house; finally went to Row.  On Tuesday, the 29<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> we went for a delightful motor&#8211;drive along the shore of Loch Lomand.  On Thursday, I went to Leeds, where I was entertained by <persName xml:id="1376" display="no">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi></persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1375" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Bodington</persName>.  On Friday I <listEvent><event xml:id="43">preached</event></listEvent> to the students of the University in Emmanuel Church: &amp; afterwards went to Westminster, where I arrived about 7 p.m.</p>
         <p>On Saturday, <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> arrived accompanied by <persName xml:id="861" display="no">Dennis Webster</persName>.</p>
