         <p>A still beautiful morning, ideally autumnal. I went to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m., and celebrated. There were but a dozen comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> all told, including <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName>, who came in appallingly late.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="1820"><hi rend="bold underline">D</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Charles</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> arrived in good time for the Abbey Service: I took him in &amp; introduced him to everybody.</hi>  Then I went to S. Margaret's, where a large congregation came together.  <ref xml:id="439">My sermon</ref> was dull, but well listened to.</p>
         <p>Offertory = &#x00A3;14.0.3. Charles stayed to lunch.</p>
         <p>There was a crowd in the Abbey at 3 p.m. when I preached for the <hi rend="underline">East London Church Fund</hi>, not very successfully, since the offertory only amounted to about &#x00A3;22. <persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1819" display="no">his niece</persName> were there, &amp; came to tea afterwards.</p>
         <p>At 7 p.m. the Dean of Peterboro (<persName xml:id="1813">Arnold Page</persName>) preached in the Abbey. He shouted tremendously but, though I listened hard, I could not disentangle the words sufficiently to 'make sense' of what I heard. He came in to supper afterwards, &amp; professed himself a 'male suffragette'!</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="803">Damms</persName>, the new minor Canon &amp; Choirhouse Master, came in also. He seems an able &amp; keen little man.</p>
