         <p>The evening papers on Friday, the 4<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Dec, announced the withdrawal of the Education Bill. Our precious performance at the so–called 'Representative Church Council' had given the last straw to the Government council<hi rend="bold">.  </hi><hi rend="bold underline">It is apparent that, without intending any deception, the Archbishop did in fact deceive the Government</hi>.  He whipped in the High Church bishops to support his 'compromise' by accepting tacitly <hi rend="underline">their</hi> interpretation of 'contracting out', which was not originally his own, &amp; was at no time the Government's.</p>
         <p>The mischievous character of the R.C.C. has again received conspicuous illustration. <persName xml:id="1748">Lord Halifax</persName>, <persName xml:id="213">Athelstan Riley</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="1736">Sir Alfred Cripps</persName> are enabled to pose as the spokesmen of the Anglican laity. Yet who that knows anything of ordinary Englishmen can doubt that they represent more than an insignificant fraction? It is, however, an organized &amp; enthusiastic faction, which makes up for the paucity of its numbers by its skilful tactics &amp; fiery zeal. <persName xml:id="764">Sir John Kennaway</persName>, <persName xml:id="1734">Col. Seton–Churchill</persName>, and <persName xml:id="1735">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Torr</persName>, the three laymen who spoke for the compromise, were assuredly representatives of the general body of lay opinion, but they spoke as individuals &amp; without either ability or enthusiasm.</p>
