         <p>This was the first Sunday in Session, and following my wont I preached a <ref xml:id="527">'political sermon'</ref>.<note xml:id="85" n="1"></note> Unfortunately the weather was unkind. Rain fell most part of the day, violently at the time of the evening service. The members seats were filled with members and their wives. I recognized <persName xml:id="193">Black Michael</persName>, <persName xml:id="539">Alfred Lyttelton</persName>, <persName xml:id="419">Craig</persName>, and <persName xml:id="344">Sir Henry Craik</persName>. My text was from I.Thess. V. "Quench not the Spirit &amp;c".</p>
         <p>The congregation at Evensong was the smallest on record.</p>

         <p>On Thursday, Nov: 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> 1906, I had an interview with a young clergyman, <persName xml:id="1154">Rev. G. H. Webb</persName>, at the request of <persName xml:id="644">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Llewelyn Davies</persName>.  This rash young man had poured out his soul to his Rector (<persName xml:id="249">Gamble</persName> of Holy Trinity, Chelsea) anent his own theological scruples.  He could not personally accept the Nicene language about our Lord &amp;c.  Gamble had taken this effusion au grand serieux, &amp; had bidden him go speak with the <persName xml:id="166">Bishop of London</persName>, &amp; get his Lordship's permission to hold these opinions!  So he sought my advice.  He read me what he had written.  It was crude and indefensible: nor did he defend it.  <hi rend="bold underline">I told him he must eat humble pie, &amp; withdraw that letter.</hi>  This he promised to do, &amp; went off somewhat dejectedly.  It is rather a case of using a steam roller to crush a butterfly to put diocesan machinery in motion to crush a muddle&#8211;headed pass&#8211;man, for this youth is no more.  <hi rend="bold underline">Unfortunately the whole standard of gravity in ecclesiastical administration has fallen so low under the present regime of emotional goodness that considerations of that kind have lost weight. </hi>

         <p>On Saturday Nov. 3<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi> 1906 there was a Funeral Service for <persName xml:id="1157">Gathorne, Earl of Cranbrook</persName>, who died this week at the advanced age of 92 years<hi rend="bold">.  </hi><persName xml:id="1158"><hi rend="italic bold underline">The Bishop of S</hi><hi rend="i bold superscript underline">t</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline"> Andrew's</hi></persName><hi rend="italic bold underline">, formerly of Truro</hi><hi rend="italic">, conducted the service.  I had not spoken to him for 20 years, when at the instance of <persName xml:id="46">Miss Leslie</persName>, I had an interview with him in the Hotel d' Angleterre at Rome.  He has greatly changed.  Then he was an ascetic&#8211;looking man, quick &amp; nervous in his movements.  He has become a stout, slow&#8211;moving man, more like a South African Millionaire (but this may have been the effect of his fur&#8211;coat) than an Anglican prelate.  He was very curt &amp; cold to me before the service; but the calm dignity of the service evidently pleased him, and </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">afterwards he was conversational and almost affectionate, reminding me of our meeting in Rome in 1886</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi>
