         </p>
         <p>A dull, raw morning, with something more than attempts to rain. There were but 22 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at 8 a.m. when I celebrated.  Of these but 6 were males, including two clergy and the clerk.</p>
         <p>The congregation was not large, but (in the badness of the weather, and the adjournment of the House) larger than I expected. I preached on 'The Discipline of Moral Failure'.</p>
         <p>At Evensong there was a large congregation. I preached on 'Christ's New Commandment', bringing thus to an end the course of sermons on the 'Decalogue'.</p>
