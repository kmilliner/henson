         <p>A wet and windy morning, and only 21 communicants at 8 a.m., when I celebrated. I used the <term xml:id="18">Embertide Collect</term>, with especial reference to <persName xml:id="851">Walters</persName>, who is being ordained this morning at S. Paul's. It carries me back, 19 years, to that lovely summer's morning in Cuddesdon when I was myself ordained. I read the Gospel, and so will Walters. May God bless him in his work here, and help me to do my duty by him!</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">I preached on the <ref xml:id="575">Christian Law of Marriage</ref> &#8211; a difficult subject enough in these days.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Accompanied by <persName xml:id="227">Murray</persName>, <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="554">Gilbert</persName>, I went to Poplar, and spoke on <listEvent><event xml:id="30">"Religion &amp; Democracy"</event></listEvent> in the Poplar Town Hall. <persName xml:id="857">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> W<hi rend="superscript underline">m</hi> Crooks</persName> M.P. was in the chair, &amp; another Labour Member was on the platform. The Choir of <orgName xml:id="9">Ilford Hospital</orgName> was present.</p>
         <p>The day had proved too faithful to its evil promise, &amp; the evening was blustering &amp; rainy. In spite of the weather, a considerable congregation collected in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>; &amp; I preached on the Temptation of Christ. I was particularly struck by the number which stayed for the little after&#8211;service.</p>

         <p>On Monday, March 12<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, 1906, I received a letter from the <persName xml:id="105">Bishop of Southwark</persName>, enclosing a copy of his Lordship's <ref xml:id="103" display="no">communication</ref> to his Diocese on the subject of Education.</p>
         <p>I seized the opportunity of writing in reply a frank expression of my sense of the impolicy of the Bishops.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">I also wrote to <persName xml:id="889">Birrell</persName> urging him to maintain the Denominational Colleges.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>On Wednesday morning I sprained my ankle slightly by stepping carelessly out of my bath. I made matters worse by walking with <persName xml:id="427">Inge</persName> on the Embankment; when I got in, after my walk, I was in much pain, &amp; could not attend <persName xml:id="117">Rashdall's</persName> Lecture.</p>
         <p>On Thursday and Friday I remained within doors, and did what work I could.</p>
         <p>On Friday evening I wrote a letter to <persName xml:id="1004">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Bunting</persName>, in answer to one from him in which he had asked me to write on "Fundamental Christianity", enclosing for my reading an article of his own on <ref xml:id="104" display="no">"Nonconformists in Parliament"</ref>.</p>
