         <p>A cold raw morning with a fine rain at intervals. <persName xml:id="55">Knox</persName> celebrated at 8 a.m. There were 30 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>The congregation at Mattins reflected the weather: it was bad, but not so bad as I feared. My sermon was on S. Luke VII.29, 30 "The discipline of repentance".</p>
