         <p>A glorious day. <persName xml:id="898">Peile</persName> came to the early Celebration, and saw the window under excellent conditions. Having deposited him in the Abbey in <persName xml:id="208">Beeching's</persName> charge, I revised my sermon on <ref xml:id="578">"The Lesson of the Earthquakes"</ref>, and went to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> to deliver it. There was a large congregation considering that many people are still absent on holiday. After lunch, Peile returned to Oxford, and I completed a Sermon for Evensong.</p>
         <p>At 7 p.m. there was again a large congregation. I preached on 1. Cor. XV. 58.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="502">Aylwyn Parker</persName> came in to supper.</p>
