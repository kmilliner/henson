         <p>The 'Times' printed most part of my selection from yesterday's Sermon, with a clear heading, <ref xml:id="282">'Prayer&#8211;Book Revision'</ref>, which may attract attention. It reads very clearly &amp; decisively. <persName xml:id="296">Duckworth</persName> expressed his cordial agreement, &amp; his own embarrassments in using the Whitsunday Preface.<note xml:id="96" n="1"></note></p>
         <p><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went off after breakfast by way of Euston.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="55">Knox</persName> had an accident, colliding with a van outside <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName>. His bicycle was smashed; &amp; he himself bruized &amp; cut. He was carried into the Hospital, &amp; there tended. His damages do not appear to be serious, but the shock must be considerable.</p>
         <p>I went off to Edinburgh via King's Cross in order to attend the <orgName xml:id="134">General Assembly of the Scottish Church</orgName>. On the way I read <persName xml:id="1491">Taylor Innes's</persName> book, <ref xml:id="283">'Church &amp; Creed in Scotland'</ref>; thus to prepare myself to take an intelligent interest in the debates. After leaving York I dined on the train.</p>
