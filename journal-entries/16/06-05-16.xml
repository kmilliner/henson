         <p>This day was expended rather aimlessly: the day was chilly &amp; dull: &amp; we were somewhat fatigued with our exertions of yesterday. However we walked to Montreux, by a circuitous route through the vineyards, &amp; there had tea in a pretentious shop. We returned by tram to Vevey.</p>
