         <p>A dull, misty morning, but no rain. I celebrated at 8 a.m. when there were but 16 communicants.</p>
         <p>'Tis the last Sunday of the religious year, and the inevitable retrospect induces melancholy. So much to do, so little done. The weary refrain of the Preacher seems the just description of one's life. 'Vanitas Vanitatum'.</p>
         <p>'So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.'</p>
         <p>There was but a moderate congregation at Mattins, when I preached on 'Ecclesiastes &amp; S. Paul', contrasting the Pessimism of the one with the Optimism of the other. At the end of my Sermon, I made a brief reference to the political situation, appealing for 'prudence &amp; conciliation' in handling the Educational problem. <persName xml:id="193">Lord S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Aldwyn</persName> was in Church; &amp; he is credited with no common influence at this juncture.</p>

         <p>In the afternoon, having copied out my aforesaid political reference, I took it to the <ref xml:id="164" display="no">'Times'</ref>.</p>
         <p>In the evening <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> was well filled: I preached on 'The Temptation of Adversity'.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="630">Bob Bineham</persName> came in to supper.</p>
