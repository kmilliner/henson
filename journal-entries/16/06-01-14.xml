         <p>The day was fine at the start.  I went to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m., and celebrated the Holy Communion.  There were but 18 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> including <persName xml:id="41">Harry</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="927" display="no">his sister</persName>.  Then I went to the Abbey, and <hi rend="bold underline">introduced <persName xml:id="117">Rashdall</persName> to the <persName xml:id="109">Archdeacon</persName></hi>: they are both exultant over the Liberal victories at Manchester, where the late <persName xml:id="508">Prime Minister</persName> is reported to have been defeated by a large majority.</p>
         <p>At Mattins I read the service; <persName xml:id="222">Albert</persName> played the organ; and <hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="114">Welldon</persName> preached the sermon.  The last was a very trying performance. With his usual colossal tactlessness, he referred again &amp; again to the Elections, &amp; this at such a time, &amp; in a church which avowedly stands outside politics</hi>.  Rashdall declaimed at length in the Abbey on the vexed &amp; vexing topic of Education.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I walked down the Embankment &amp; back with <persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName>.</p>
         <p>At Evensong there was a very large congregation. I preached on "The Name Christian".</p>
