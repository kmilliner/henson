         <p>A lovely day, warm and bright. There were 35 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at 8 a.m., among them <persName xml:id="1162">George Mackarness</persName> who is staying here &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Talbot.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="692">Carlile</persName> of the <orgName xml:id="50">Church Army</orgName> preached at Mattins. His sermon was filled with the most amazing &amp; insolent 'topical' allusions, and much crude sensationalism; but the man is known to work hard, &amp; is believed to do good: &amp; much is forgiven him. I added a few words of commendation. The collection was for the Hospitals: but plates were held at the doors for the Church Army. These contained more than &#x00A3;29 to which was subsequently added &#x00A3;5.</p>
         <p>Carlile lunched here; &amp; greatly amazed us with his talk. <persName xml:id="554">Gilbert</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="826">Ernest</persName>, who were also here, were mightily impressed.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon we, i.e. George, the two boys, &amp; myself, went to Deptford, where I addressed rather a dreary company of men in a very dreary church. The weather which had become close &amp; sultry, now declined into its too&#8211;familiar mood of rain. This injured the Evening congregation. I preached for the Hospitals, &amp; raked in nearly &#x00A3;21. But our collections for the Hospitals will be the smallest on record.</p>
