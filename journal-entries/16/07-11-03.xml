         <p>A dull and dubious day tending to rain. I went to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Marg<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi></orgName> at 8 a.m., and assisted <persName xml:id="55">Knox</persName> at the Celebration.  There were 28 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>There was a large congregation at Mattins. In the Parl<hi rend="superscript underline">tary</hi> seats I observed <persName xml:id="665">Butcher</persName> and <persName xml:id="1246">Emmott</persName>.  I preached on 2.Tim.iv.7.8, which came into the 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> lesson.  Afterwards I celebrated the Holy Communion.  There were 99 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="121">Custard</persName> pleading illness: I had him round to the Rectory, &amp; sent for <persName xml:id="708">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Troutbeck</persName>, who reported nothing seriously wrong: but ordered caution &amp; some days in bed.  So I released him from his duty at Evensong, &amp; sent him home.</p>
         <p>There was a large congregation at Evensong: and the service went as well as might be expected without the Organist. I preached an old sermon on 'The Probation of Saints' rather over the heads of the congregation.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="861" display="no">Dennis Webster</persName> went off to Portsmouth.</p>
