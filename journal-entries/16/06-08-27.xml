         <p>We packed our trunks, and took a kind farewell of our <persName xml:id="1077">friends</persName>, and so departed. Leaving Crieff at 1.50 p.m., having picked up on the way the silver sauce bowl gained by <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> in a Bazaar raffle, we changed at Crieff Junction, and then went on to Glasgow by way of Dunblane &amp; Stirling. At the Queen Street Station we ran into <persName xml:id="1087" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Johnstone</persName>, the owner of the Hanging Shaw, Selkirk.  We reached Auchinlea, Helensburgh about 6 p.m., and found <persName xml:id="290">Charlie Parker</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="950">Dorothy</persName> his wife visiting there.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">The papers reported another abominable outrage from Russia. Some miscreant attempted to destroy the Premier, <persName xml:id="1088" display="no">M. Stolypin</persName>, with a bomb. The victim escaped, but no less than 30 persons were killed by the explosion, and many injured. Among the latter were his two children.<note xml:id="69" n="1"></note></hi>
