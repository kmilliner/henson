         <p>Another glorious day.  A slight mist added to the beauty of the view.  Nothing could exceed that beauty.  The colouring of the blue lake, the bright green foliage in the fore&#8211;ground, the red&#8211;tiled houses, the snow&#8211;capped mountains, the cloudless sky is enchanting.  I loafed on the terrace and <hi rend="bold underline">read the new volume of the <ref xml:id="97">Cambridge History</ref></hi>, until lunch. In the afternoon we all went by the funicular to Mont P&#x00E9;lerin, where we had tea, and walked in the wood: but the air became sultry, and ominous rumblings of thunder seemed to presage a storm. So we hastened back to the Hotel. The light effects on the lake, &amp; in the Rhone valley were striking: &amp; a beautiful rainbow added an unexpected trait to the sombre scene. There was some rain during the night, but no storm.</p>
         <p>An old acquaintance of <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> appeared in a Swiss doctor, <persName xml:id="911" display="no">Muret</persName>, who sate with us after dinner, &amp; conversed not uninterestingly of men &amp; things. </p>
