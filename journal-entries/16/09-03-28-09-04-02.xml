         <p>A wet morning. I celebrated at 8 a.m. when there were but 12 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, suspecting influenza &amp; feeling unwell, kept to her room: and <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> recovering from influenza remained within doors.</p>
         <p>The congregation at Mattins was wretchedly small: and the offertory did not reach the miserable amount of &#x00A3;7. <persName xml:id="851">Walters</persName> being down with influenza: <persName xml:id="803">Dams</persName> volunteered to sing the service, &amp; did so very excellently. I preached an old sermon on "Self&#8211;judgement &amp; the judgement of others".</p>
         <p>At Evensong there was an improved congregation, though the weather remained bad.</p>
