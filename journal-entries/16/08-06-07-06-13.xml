         <p><persName xml:id="55">Knox</persName> celebrated at 7 a.m: I at 8 a.m: the <persName xml:id="296">Sub Dean</persName> at 11 a.m. The communicants numbered 211, as against 208 last year. At Mattins Knox made the statutory declaration of 'assent' to the 39 Articles. I preached on the phrase, 'The sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God'.</p>
         <p>The Sub&#8211;Dean &amp; the <persName xml:id="560">Admiral</persName> came in to lunch.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="1204">Mary Scott</persName> came to consult me about books for her <persName xml:id="1256">sister</persName> in India, who has been reading a Rationalist book, &amp; is there with mentally troubled.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="117">Rashdall</persName> came to see me during the afternoon.</p>
         <p>I preached at Evensong to a mixed company of tourists.</p>

         <p>On Monday (the 8<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> June, 1908) &#8211; a full week before we expected him &#8211; our <hi rend="bold underline"><orgName xml:id="94">Pan&#8211;Anglican Congress</orgName> guest arrived. He is the delegate from the diocese of Fredericton, </hi><persName xml:id="1609" display="no"><hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Justice Hanington</hi></persName>. He is a Judge of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. He was accompanied by <persName xml:id="1617">Archdeacon Armitage</persName>, of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Paul's Halifax, Nova Scotia.  The latter had some knowledge of London, and, fortunately for me, acted as guide to my guest, who had never been in England before.</p>
         <p>On Friday, <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName> returned; and the same afternoon we attended <persName xml:id="215">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Asquith's</persName> first Garden Party in Downing Street.</p>

         <p><persName xml:id="1300" display="no">Cyril Merton</persName> dined here: he &amp; <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> discoursed sweet music to us after dinner.</p>
