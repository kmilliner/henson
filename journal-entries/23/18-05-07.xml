After an early lunch we (<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, Norcock<persName xml:id="4345"></persName> &amp; I) motored to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Much Wenlock vi&#x00E2;</hi><hi> Leominster &amp; Ludlow, a distance of about 40 miles. Unfortunately rain began to fall soon after we started, &amp; hindered us from enjoying the country. At Much Wenlock I confirmed 26 candidates &amp; gave an address from the words. "</hi><hi rend="underline">He endured as seeing Him who is invisible"</hi><hi>. The service was reverent, &amp; I trust, edifying. After it had finished, we had tea with M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Furlong, &amp; were then taken charge of by Miss Gaskell, the daughter of the proprietor of the old Cluniac Priory. She showed as the Prior's House, a fascinating medieval residence. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Gaskell<persName xml:id="4566"></persName> is the patron of Much Wenlock, &amp; one of the two squires. The other is M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> J. H. A. Whitley Bourton. He was in church, &amp; afterwards came into the vestry &amp; introduced himself. The church of the Holy Trinity, Much Wenlock, is a fine medieval building full of interesting features, which, however, I had no time to examine with adequate care. Even through the rain, it was apparent that the little town is of rare beauty &amp; interest. We started on our return journey about 5.30 p.m. and were back in the close about 8 p.m. 40 miles in 2Â½ hours, an average of 16 miles an hour. There is a good deal of hill work which for a bad climber like our car makes for delay: &amp; the sodden state of the roads did not improve matters.</hi>
