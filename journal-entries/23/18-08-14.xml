<hi>Another cloudless day. The news much the same as yesterday. I spent the forenoon in writing letters,<note xml:id="447" n="1"></note> including one to M. Paul Sabatier<persName xml:id="1320"></persName>, of which a copy is here inserted [small drawing of a pointing hand]. The discomfort caused by the state of my right eye, where a "stye" or some similar abomination had developed itself, made all employment distasteful. I wrote to Compston<persName xml:id="2010"></persName> about the institution on Sept. 8</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> : &amp; to Lady Markham<persName xml:id="4623"></persName> crying off my engagement to preach in Mansfield on Oct. 9</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> on the plea that I must attend the P.B. Revision Conference in London.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>If I had the energy and the perseverance which the task requires I should now devote myself to acquiring facility in French and Latin, with a view to developments after the War. It is certain that there will [sic] much intercourse between France and England, and many attempts to negociate some kind of union between the Churches will be made. The man who can hold conversation with the foreigners in their own tongue will be at a great advantage. It is not improbable that I myself shall come somewhat prominently into the foreground, if serious negociations should be entered upon, as well because I have become so closely associated with efforts at friendlier relations with Non&#8211;episcopalians as because I am a Bishop. But in my present inability to carry on a conversation in French, how great will be the disadvantage at which I shall stand! Yet, in the chronic hustle in which I seem doomed to live, what real prospect is there of my being able to give time to mastering languages, or doing anything beyond the mere insistent business of the moment?</hi>

<hi>My dear M. Sabatier,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Your kind letter of July 28</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> gave me very great pleasure, and, though indeed its expressions are far too generous for my merits, yet I allow myself to interpret them as evidences of your goodwill, &amp; to receive them as such with genuine gratitude. You will believe me when I say that the prevailing motive wh. led me to accept episcopal office was the hope that as a Bishop I might the more effectually help forward the cause of Christian Unity, not only within the English&#8211;speaking sphere, but also over the whole area of the Christian discipleship.</hi> 
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I have been suffering from an indisposition which has compelled me to retire from my work for a few weeks. You will accept this circumstance as an excuse for so brief a reply to your eloquent &amp; suggestive letter, for which I beg you to accept my most cordial thanks.</hi> 
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Assuredly, even the vast sacrifices of this cruel &amp; protracted War would not be an excessive price to pay for such a quickening of the Christian conscience as would make the Christian Society, evangelical and truly Catholic, a visible and energising Power capable of providing a sound foundation for the Peace of the World.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>With great respect,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Believe me,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>My dear M. Sabatier,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Your faithful &amp; obliged,</hi>
         </p>

<hi>H. H. Hereford.</hi>
