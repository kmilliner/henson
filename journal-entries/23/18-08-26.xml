<hi>The weather seems to have broken at last. I read Cowper's<persName xml:id="4537"></persName> verse for an hour before getting up. In "Table talk"<ref xml:id="1022"></ref> there is a capital description of the Kaiser<persName xml:id="4705"></persName>! We have in fact been carried back to the time of Frederick the Great<persName xml:id="4564"></persName> by his admirer, and (alas!) imitator:&#8211;</hi>

<hi>But let eternal infamy pursue</hi>

<hi>The wretch to naught but his ambition true:</hi>

<hi rend="underline">Who, for the sake of filling with one blast</hi>

<hi rend="underline">The post&#8211;horns of all Europe, lays her waste.</hi>

<hi>Think yourself station'd on a towering rock,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>To see a people scatter'd like a flock,</hi>

         <p>
<hi>Some royal mastiff panting at their heels;</hi>

<hi>Those ensigns of dominion, how disgraced!</hi>

<hi>The glass that bids man mark the fleeting hour,</hi>

<hi>Then grace the bony phantom in their stead,</hi>

<hi>With the king's shoulder&#8211;knot and gay cockade;</hi>

<hi>Clothe the tarin brethren in each other's dress,</hi>

<hi>When Tumult lately burst his prison door,</hi>

<hi>When the rude rabble's watchword was â€“ Destroy,</hi>

<hi>And blazing London seemed a second Troy,</hi>

<hi>Liberty blush'd, and hung her drooping head,</hi>

<hi>Beheld their progress with the deepest dread;</hi>

<hi>Blush'd that effects like these she should produce,</hi>

<hi>Worse than the deeds of galley&#8211;slaves broke loose.</hi>

<hi rend="underline">Churchill, himself unconscious of his powers,</hi>

         <p>
<hi rend="underline">In penury consumed his idle hours;</hi>

         <p>
<hi>And, like a scattered seed at random sown</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Was left to spring by vigour of his own.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Lifted at length, by dignity of thought</hi>

         <p>
<hi>And dint of genius, to an affluent lot,</hi>

<hi>Surly, and slovenly, and bold and coarse,</hi>

<hi>Too proud for art, and trusting in mere force,</hi>

<hi>Spendthrift alike of money and of wit,</hi>

<hi>Always at speed, &amp; never drawing bit.</hi>

<hi>He struck the lyre in such a careless mood,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>And so disdain'd the rules he understood,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The laurel seem'd to wait on his command,</hi>

<hi>He snatch'd it rudely from the Muses' hand.</hi>

<hi>Cowper's great power as a satirist is well shown in the poem "Hope"<ref xml:id="1023"></ref>. It is here that he introduces his famous eulogy of Whitfield<persName xml:id="4702"></persName> (Leuconomus). This eulogy was creditable to him as indicating both courage &amp; piety, but it is said to have compromised the success of his volume of verse, so strong at the time was the prejudice against the great Methodist preacher.</hi>

         <p>
<hi>I wrote several letters, including one to </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Hugh Cecil</hi><persName xml:id="314"></persName><hi>, who has an admirable letter in today's "</hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi>", written in response to a request from the Dean of Christ Church<persName xml:id="120"></persName> to inform his constitutents of his views on </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Lansdowne's</hi><persName xml:id="1591"></persName><hi> letter.<note xml:id="426" n="2"></note> The news from France is still very good. Not only are the British making unexpectedly rapid advances over very difficult ground, but there are unmistakeable signs of demoralization among the Germans. The soldiers surrender with astonishing facility, and the resistance they offer is far less strenuous than might fairly be expected.</hi>
