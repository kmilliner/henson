<hi>I worked at the Oxford sermon all the morning: &amp; in the afternoon motored to Ballingham in order to look at the churchyard, &amp; consider how it can be enlarged. The Archdeacon<persName xml:id="4450"></persName> went with me. We were met at the church by M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Fisher<persName xml:id="4562"></persName> the Vicar, his churchwarden, &amp; Lord Chesterfield's<persName xml:id="4670"></persName> agent. The little parish church of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Dubricius has rather a fine porch, and a Jacobean pulpit. I was pleased with its carefully&#8211;kept appearance. We visited the other little church, said to be dedicated to S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> John of Jerusalem.</hi> <hi rend="italic">I sent in notice of a resolution to be moved at the next meeting of Convocation asking the Abp.<persName xml:id="128"></persName> to appoint a small Committee of doctors, lawyers, social students, &amp; divines to consider the Marriage Law.</hi>
