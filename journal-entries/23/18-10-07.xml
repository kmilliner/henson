<hi>The morning was wet &amp; comfortless. I was so full of aches and pains that I decided to abandon my journey to London. Accordingly</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">I wrote to the Archbishop<persName xml:id="128"></persName> excusing my absence, and telegraphed to the Hotel to cancel my room</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> Archdeacon Winnington&#8211;Ingram<persName xml:id="4450"></persName> came to see me, &amp; stayed to lunch; also Archdeacon <persName xml:id="3618">Lilley</persName> called.</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">William Badham</hi><persName xml:id="4501"></persName><hi> came to get a letter of commendation from me.

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Prince Max of Baden</hi><persName xml:id="4628"></persName><hi> has lost no time in disclosing the purpose of his appointment to the Chancellorship. He has addressed himself to President Wilson<persName xml:id="2814"></persName>, asking an armistice, and offering to conclude peace on the basis of the 14 articles. But there is little disposition on the part of the Allies to respond to advances which are thought to be insincere. Meanwhile, with their usual brutal stupidity, the Germans continue to destroy the villages &amp; towns from which they are retiring. Douai is reported to be in flames.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">In </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Baxter's</hi><persName xml:id="5"></persName> <hi rend="italic">"Nonconformists' Plea for Peace"<ref xml:id="354"></ref> there is much that throws light on the religious condition of the country towards the end of Charles II's reign e.g. a striking description of the varieties of teaching and practice in the parish churches. "Nay I have myself communicated in a conformable Parish church in London, where one half kneel at the receiving of the Sacrament, &amp; the other sit: and all this without any violation of love or concord, without any grudging or mischievous effects; so that experience shameth the dreaming fears of imposing men" [v. Part II, p. 158f]. This treatise was published in 1680.</hi>
