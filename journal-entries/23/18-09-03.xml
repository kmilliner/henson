<hi>Our guests departed. The Spooners<persName xml:id="383"><persName xml:id="2162"></persName></persName> travelled with me as far as the Craven Arms. I went on to Church Stretton, and there took part in the public opening of a Hall &amp; Institute, designed as a "national memorial" of Silvester Horne<persName xml:id="323"></persName>. Birrell<persName xml:id="889"></persName> was the principal speaker, &amp; “barrelled” very pleasantly. I made a speech which was very well received. After the function I had tea with Prebendary Auden<persName xml:id="4500"></persName> and his daughters. These ladies accompanied me to the station. I got home shortly before 9 p.m. In my absence Penelope<persName xml:id="2937"></persName> and her nurse arrived. It would seem that we shall be in no want of guests while we remain in Hereford! The War news continues to be excellent.</hi>
