<hi>To my surprise </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">George Nimmins</hi><persName xml:id="3571"></persName><hi> turned up at breakfast time. He was travelling from Devonport to Liverpool, and finding himself at Hereford, decided to break his journey! Such is the cheerful</hi> <hi rend="underline">insouciance</hi><hi> of youth, for of course we might have been absent, or unwelcoming! Happily neither contingency occurred to disappoint him. I wrote the sermon for All Saints with</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">George</hi><hi> asleep on my sofa. After lunch we walked along the river bank as far as Belmont, and returned by the road. The distance was petty enough, but I have become so "soft" by lack of exercise that I was quite fatigued.</hi>

<hi>The fruit trees (Pears, Apples, Plums, &amp; Gooseberries) purchased for the garden cost &#x00A3;6.4.0. How long will it be before I am re&#8211;imbursed by the value of the fruit?</hi>
