<hi>I walked to Westminster &amp; ascertained from Pearce<persName xml:id="636"></persName> the hour of the funeral tomorrow. Then I went on to Lambeth joining</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Runciman</hi><persName xml:id="990"></persName><hi> on the way. Here we attended the Conference of Leaders of Churches convened to consider how best to advance the League of Nations project. Every church save the Papist was represented. There was much windy speaking, but nothing much was </hi> <hi rend="underline">done</hi><hi>. Knight<persName xml:id="62"></persName> was there, &amp; came away with me. I mentioned the probable vacancy at Weobley, &amp; asked him whether he w</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> care to take it. Rather to my surprise, he seemed attracted by the prospect, though anxious to make sure that he w</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> not be buried. We lunched together, and then walked in the Park. On my return to the Club<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName> I wrote to</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Treherne</hi><persName xml:id="4426"></persName><hi>, excusing my absence from the S.P.C.C. meeting tomorrow, and sending&#x00A3;1. to the collection. Then I wrote to</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Mary</hi><persName xml:id="1204"></persName><hi>.</hi> <hi rend="italic">The Archbishop<persName xml:id="128"></persName> came into the Club, and I had some speech with him. He gave me an account of the "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Life and Liberty</hi><hi rend="italic">" deputation,<note xml:id="399" n="1"></note> which he had sent away in rather a crest&#8211;fallen condition. I asked him what he had meant by saying at the Bishops' meeting that some people thought the debate on the Church &amp; State Report w</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi> <hi rend="italic">"fizzle out", and he said that </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lord H. Cecil</hi><persName xml:id="314"></persName><hi rend="italic"> w</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic"> move its formal acceptance, and the postponement of the serious discussion: He added that he looked forward to my speaking. He was evidently anxious to give the impression that he was not so deeply committed to the "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Life &amp; Liberty</hi><hi rend="italic">" fanaticks as I suspect. I dined at the Club.</hi>
