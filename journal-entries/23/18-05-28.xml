<hi>After breakfast in the club<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, I fell in with Watkins<persName xml:id="590"></persName>, from whom I gather that the attempt to get hold of some portion of the decanal revenues is not yet abandoned by the hungry university. Then I wrote letters, &amp; among them</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">one to Fawkes<persName xml:id="1082"></persName> in which I suggested that he sh</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">d</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> become my hon: chaplain</hi><hi rend="bold">:</hi>

<hi rend="italic">"It is of course a mere compliment, but it indicates a measure both of congruity and of friendship, &amp; serves so far as an index&#8211;finger for the guidance of the public.

<hi>I wrote to Matthews<persName xml:id="4626"></persName> promising to lecture at 5.30 p.m. on "Anglicanism, Essence &amp; Value" on October 17</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>, &amp; suggesting Lord Bryce<persName xml:id="389"></persName> as Chairman.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Also, I wrote to Cecil Ferens<persName xml:id="4218"></persName>, to Marston about drawing Anglicans &amp; Huguenots together, &amp; to Chancellor Lias<persName xml:id="4611"></persName>, about his Book on the Creed<ref xml:id="999"></ref>, &amp; to M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> S. Pelham<persName xml:id="4653"></persName> about Interchange of Pulpits.</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">I lunched very pleasantly with Buchan<persName xml:id="984"></persName> &amp; Rait<persName xml:id="3475"></persName> as my table&#8211;companions – two excellent Scots</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> Prothero<persName xml:id="1394"></persName> was in the smoking room.

<hi>Rashdall<persName xml:id="117"></persName> walked with me to Westminster. At the entering of <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName>, we encountered Sir Henry Craik<persName xml:id="344"></persName>, who at once opened fire on me about my luckless sermon in S. John's, Westminster. He is prodigiously absurd, but I believe the little man has a good heart, &amp; so I spake the "soft answer" of the Proverb to him,<note xml:id="441" n="1"></note> &amp; so went on my way to the "Church &amp; State" Committee.<note xml:id="351" n="1"></note> From 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. the Committee talked. Very little progress was made, and everybody was almost suspiciously polite. Lord Selborne<persName xml:id="311"></persName> &amp; Lord Hugh Cecil<persName xml:id="314"></persName> gave me the impression of a consciousness that they had not behaved well.</hi> <hi rend="italic">Before the session broke up, I gave notice that on the morrow I w</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic"> move an amendment designed to preserve Deans sitting </hi><hi rend="italic underline">ex officio</hi><hi rend="italic">, &amp; to extinguish the proctors of the Chapters.</hi><hi> After tea at the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, I walked for an hour with Rashdall in the Park, &amp; then returned to the Club, and wrote to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>. I dined with Oman<persName xml:id="2141"></persName> and Welldon<persName xml:id="114"></persName>. The last is an arrant humbug, &amp; was only saved from some faithful speaking on the subject by the former's presence. Then I wrote to Linetta<persName xml:id="1255"></persName> suggesting that she sh</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> give me tea one day this week. Finally I wrote up my journal. The news from the Front is not very satisfactory. Evidently the Germans are in great force, and the Allies have to give ground. The latest news is that the enemy is across the Aisne, which is certainly not pleasant to hear. The tone of the communications is grave but firm. Foch<persName xml:id="4563"></persName> is said to have large reserves, &amp; to be ready to use them when he thinks fit, &amp; not when the Germans hope to compel.</hi>
