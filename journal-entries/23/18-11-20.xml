<hi>I received a telegram from <persName xml:id="4506">Beattie</persName> in these rather cryptic terms: "Received wire regret must reconsider decision impossible House Family for had just written writing again". This presumably expresses the effect of his wife's telegram of protest. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Beattie<persName xml:id="4507"></persName> came to lunch, and we talked over the matter. It does not appear that the difficulties are really insurmountable. We agreed to send the vacillating divine a further telegram in these terms:&#8211; "Have seen Bishop; we both think decision should be postponed till your return". I have no greater loathing for anything than for indecision! After lunch I attended a meeting of the Diocesan Council for Rescue Work &amp;c., over which the Archdeacon<persName xml:id="4450"></persName> presided. Then I walked for an hour with <persName xml:id="3618">Lilley</persName>. Finally I returned to my room, &amp; started working at the Advent Lectures. Mainly a wasted day.</hi>
