<hi>A sultry day ending in violent thunder&#8211;storms. I wrote to Lady Londonderry<persName xml:id="2817"></persName> (dowager) and to Elizabeth Smith<persName xml:id="4472" display="no"></persName>, who is preparing for Newnham. After an early lunch, we set out in the motor for</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Highley</hi><hi>, where I had arranged to consecrate an extension of the Church Yard. Shortly after leaving Tenbury, the car broke down, &amp; it took William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> some 40 minutes to get it started again. We arrived Â¾ hour after the time fixed! The church was well&#8211;filled: &amp; after Evensong the consecration took place. There were threatenings of a downpour, so I adjourned to the church, and addressed the people there. After missing our way once or twice on the return journey, we reached home soon after 9 p.m.</hi>

<hi>The Vicar of Highley (Rev. A. E. A. Shields<persName xml:id="4677"></persName>) speaks with a strong Welsh accent, &amp; was educated at Durham University. The Vicarage is a pleasant old house, dating, I was assured, from the 16</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> century. There are coal&#8211;mines in the parish, which had much the aspect of prosperous squalour which marks the mining parishes of Durham. The population is nearly 2000 souls, but the Easter Communicants numbered no more than 120, and (what was even more disconcerting) the parson mentioned the number with evident pride! There is a very steep hill at the entrance of the parish as it is approached from the south. The car failed to carry us up this hill, &amp; we got out &amp; walked, save myself, for whom a dog&#8211;cart was sent. But William succeeded in getting the empty car up.</hi>
