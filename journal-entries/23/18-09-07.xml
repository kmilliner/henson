<hi>There was a heavy mist far on into the day, which cleared about noon, &amp; was bright for a short space, but soon came back to rain. Rain fell heavily as the afternoon drew towards evening. The temperature was high. So far as I did anything, I worked at the Lecture for King's College. If I could have three months, I might produce something worth reading, but this "hand&#8211;to&#8211;mouth" composition is worthless.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">After lunch I walked to 13 Whitehorse Road to inquire about William Badham's<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> state. He is well enough to get out, and is intending to drive me tomorrow. I looked in at the club<orgName xml:id="318"></orgName> where I found Admiral Bosanquet<persName xml:id="4515"></persName> and Prebendary Hopton<persName xml:id="4280"></persName>.</hi><hi> Then I returned to the Palace and had tea. The Dowager Countess of Chesterfield<persName xml:id="4671"></persName> and M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Stanhope came to tea. The former is a wonderful old woman alleged to be 91 years old. After dinner I read Creighton's<persName xml:id="118"></persName> History of the Papacy<ref xml:id="1028"></ref>. His account of Pope Paul II is sympathetic and informing.</hi>
