<hi>I gave over to my Banker (1) a war loan certificate<note xml:id="283" n="1"></note> for &#x00A3;500; (2) my Insurance policy for &#x00A3;1500 together with notices of 3 quinquennial increments.</hi>

<hi>I paid wages to the servants here: and had some talk with the Archdeacon<persName xml:id="4450"></persName>. At noon the</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Rev. C. F. Doddrell</hi><persName xml:id="4546"></persName><hi> called to know if he dispense [sic] with the curate whom (to oblige a deceased parishioner) he has hitherto kept at Welsh Bicknor, a tiny parish with but 18 people. The squire is a papist, Col. Vaughan<persName xml:id="4693"></persName>, brother of the cardinal<persName xml:id="4482"></persName>. Of course, I authorized the curate's dismissal. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> D. is a friend of Sir John Barran<persName xml:id="2069"></persName>, &amp; had heard much of me from him. He was followed by</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">a Sectary</hi><hi>, who is secretary of the Bible Society<orgName xml:id="198"></orgName>. (I always feel quite aggressively prelatical when these snuffling gentry come into view, however.) After lunch the Archdeacon joined me, &amp; we interviewed that feeble creature,</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Nelson</hi><persName xml:id="4341"></persName><hi>, Vicar of Leominster, with respect to the union of Stoke Prior and Humber. As a result of the interview, I wrote to M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Wright<persName xml:id="4457"></persName>, Patron of Pudlestone, and to M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Rome<persName xml:id="4662"></persName>, Vicar of Humber. Nelson was succeeded by</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">the Mayor</hi><persName xml:id="4212"></persName><hi>, who wanted me to write a formal request for the release of Percy Hull<persName xml:id="4595"></persName>, the assistant organist, who has been in the hands of the Germans for more than 3 years. Then came</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Norcock<persName xml:id="4345"></persName>,</hi><hi> with more letters: so the day slipped away in muddling over trivialities. I wrote to Olive<persName xml:id="1696"></persName>, and arranged a few more of the books. The work on the drains is proceeding, &amp; the Palace is now surrounded with a trench for drainage pipes, and has the aspect of a beleaguered fort. The date of possible entry is still said to be "early in July".</hi>
