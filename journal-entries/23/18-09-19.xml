<hi>The day was fine, save for the occasional shower, but much colder. I spent the morning in futile work on the Lecture. After lunch I motored with <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and Kitty<persName xml:id="1209"></persName> to Ledbury, and there called on the Vicar, Carnegy<persName xml:id="4525"></persName>. He showed us the parish church, which is on a grand scale, &amp; full of interest. Also we visited St. Katherine's Hospital.</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">On our way home we called on M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Riley, the brother (I think) of the redoubtable Athelstan<persName xml:id="213"></persName>. This is the man who opposed my confirmation as bishop, but none the less I called on him &amp; found him a dull man who keeps many bullocks</hi><hi rend="bold">!</hi><hi> Our homeward way was lightened by a beautiful rainbow. The authorities allow us no more than 30 tons of coal for the whole year. Bateman<persName xml:id="4471"></persName> says that the consumption last year was no less than 80 tons.</hi>
