<hi>I read for an hour before getting up that painfully interesting book "The Village Labourer 1760&#8211;1832"<ref xml:id="1005"></ref> by J. L. Hammond<persName xml:id="4577"></persName> &amp; Barbara Hammond" (Longman's). If all that cruel story of monotonous &amp; sustained oppression, hypocritical on one side, infinitely degrading on the other, be indeed a living tradition in the minds of the peasantry what a treasury of hatred there is for the agitator to draw upon!</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">Bolshevism in England ceases to be incredible</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> I spent the morning in my study preparing for the Birmingham sermon. In the afternoon I went to All Saints church, and was shown over by Treherne<persName xml:id="4426"></persName>. The collection of chained books is amazingly interesting. It was bequeathed in the 18</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> century. I had no idea that the practice of chaining books persisted to so comparatively recent a time. The carved miserere stalls with their tabernacles are admirable examples of medieval woodwork. The church has many other features of interest. I had tea with the Trehernes.</hi>
