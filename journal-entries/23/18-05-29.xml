<hi>I prepared a speech in defence of Deans, &amp; in due course fired it off in the Committee, where it was well received. Indeed, all through the day I was on good terms with the Committee, &amp; got more of my way than I might have expected. I lunched with Ernest<persName xml:id="636"></persName>, and called on Lady Londonderry<persName xml:id="2817"></persName>. I found her at home, &amp; the Rogersons<persName xml:id="3438"><persName xml:id="3439"></persName></persName> with her.</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">I dined with Ker<persName xml:id="22"></persName> at the United Universities Club<orgName xml:id="320"></orgName> in Suffolk Street</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> We were alone, &amp; talked with more than ordinary intimacy of friendship. What a good fellow he is, so vastly learned &amp; withal so modest, one of the very best men the world contains. We walked as far as the Palace, &amp; back, &amp; there parted. My letters today include a loving epistle from George<persName xml:id="3571"></persName>, who sails for America next Monday: another rhapsodical letter from Ernest, whose marriage to the Greek beauty has been postponed: a letter from J. G. Wilson<persName xml:id="2748"></persName> in which he laments my absence from the Chapter&#8211;meetings, &amp; one from Cruickshank<persName xml:id="1898"></persName>, saying </hi> <hi rend="bold underline">that they were beginning to groan under the Archidiaconal<persName xml:id="590"></persName> r&#x00E9;gime</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> The rest were appeals for preaching which I shall have to refuse.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I called on Linetta<persName xml:id="1255"></persName> who was out. Incidentally I discovered that she lives in 15 Palace Street,</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">not</hi><hi> Bridge St. as I absurdly supposed. So my affectionate note of yesterday will go astray! The news from the front continues to be grave. The Germans are still advancing, &amp; have now gained about 15 miles. This is rather all ill beginning to Foch's<persName xml:id="4563"></persName> supreme command. The experiment of mingling British with French troops appears to be rather a dangerous one.</hi>
