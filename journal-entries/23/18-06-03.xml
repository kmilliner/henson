<hi>After breakfasting with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Radcliffe</hi><persName xml:id="4657"></persName><hi> in the Club<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, and writing some letters, I walked to Westminster, &amp; called on </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Gamble</hi><persName xml:id="249"></persName><hi>. Then I picked up</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ernest Rudling</hi><persName xml:id="600"></persName><hi> at the North Porch of the Abbey, &amp; walked with him for nearly an hour. He is now a lieutenant in the R.F.C., and has a wound stripe on his arm. He has grown taller &amp; stouter, but remains recognizable.</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">Then I paid my hotel bill, &amp; came away to Paddington</hi><hi> where I lunched. At the table sate a youngish man with the suns of India on his cheek, who addressed me by name, &amp; said that he had met me many years ago. His name was </hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Curtis</hi><hi>, &amp; he has a cottage in my diocese, near Ledbury. I travelled to Hereford by the 1.30 p.m. As far as Malvern I had the company of a lady, who said that she had met me at dinner some years ago. I remembered the occasion but not her.</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">The Archdeacon of Hereford</hi><persName xml:id="4450"></persName><hi> met me at the station with the unexpected announcement that the "Pilgrims" expected me to "dismiss" them at 8 p.m. The function was wrongly noted in my book for tomorrow. However I hastily prepared some notes, &amp; gave a brief "charge" to the 14 "pilgrims" who presented themselves in the Lady Chapel. I laid my hand on every head, &amp; said: "I authorize you to minister as a Pilgrim in my diocese during the month of June, &amp; may God bless your ministry to the People". Then I went home &amp; dined. Afterwards I wrote to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, &amp; went through my letters.</hi>
