<hi>I prepared some notes for a speech on Foreign Missions, before breakfast, and afterwards went to the Palace and finished the Oxford sermon. After lunch I motored to Ledbury taking out Sir Robert Lighton<persName xml:id="4613"></persName>. He presided at a meeting in the interest of the Church Missionary Society<orgName xml:id="124"></orgName> held in the garden of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Katherine's Hospital. I made a speech and was followed by a missionary from China who had lived there for 26 years and acquired so Chinese an aspect that when he clothed himself in a mandarin's garment he looked a thorough native. I carried Sir Robert Lighton home, &amp; then went on to the Palace &amp; wrote letters. The German advance has been nearly arrested, but they claim to have used up the French reserves.</hi>
