<hi>I read the 'Times' and wrote 3 letters before getting up. After breakfasting in the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>,</hi> <hi rend="italic">I wrote more letters, made an extract of my sermon in the Abbey &amp; sent it to K.<persName xml:id="62"></persName> for the "Times", and prepared notes for the Albert Hall speech tonight. Having lunched at the Club, I walked to Westminster, &amp; at the Church House got hold of the new number of the "Church Quarterly", and </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">read Headlam's<persName xml:id="552"></persName> article on my appointment<ref xml:id="1000"></ref>. It is written in a fair spirit, &amp; exposes the shameless garbling of quotations, of which the E.C.U.<orgName xml:id="20"></orgName> was guilty when it published the pamphlet, "D</hi><hi rend="i bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline"> Hensley Henson's Opinions"</hi><hi rend="italic">. I fear, however, that the readers of the pamphlet are not likely to see the Article. I called on Car&#x00F6;e<persName xml:id="648"></persName>, whom I found at home, &amp; on Lady Ilbert<persName xml:id="2416"></persName>, who had just left for Penn. Then I walked back to the Club &amp; had tea, after which I called on Miss Mundella<persName xml:id="2712"></persName>, &amp; then went to the Albert Hall for the Centenary of the British &amp; Foreign Sailors' Society<orgName xml:id="300"></orgName>.</hi> <hi rend="italic bold underline">Lord Crewe<persName xml:id="1056"></persName> presided, &amp; Admiral Jellicoe<persName xml:id="4294"></persName> was the principal speaker</hi><hi rend="i bold">.</hi> <hi rend="italic">There was a considerable audience, but not so large as I expected.</hi> <hi rend="italic bold underline">I spoke for about 20 minutes; my speech was much applauded</hi><hi rend="i bold">.</hi> <hi rend="italic">I came away about 10 minutes after 9 o'clock, when the meeting had gone on for more than 2 hours. I got a scrap of supper at an exorbitant price â€“ 6/6 for a fragment of cold chicken &amp; a bottle of Perrier water &#8211; &amp; then, having read the telegrams in the Club, went back to the Hotel &amp; to bed.</hi>
