<hi>Another brilliant day, with the aeroplanes clamourous in the sky. The post brought a note from <persName xml:id="813">Arthur Rawle</persName> saying that his son, <persName xml:id="4907">William</persName>, had been killed in France. Thus the price of victory rises steadily as the conflict is protracted. Not being wholly presentable, I did not attempt attendance at Divine Service, but stayed at home, and sate in the garden with writing materials to hand. I wrote to Arthur Rawle, and to Kitty<persName xml:id="1209"></persName> Inge. Later <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I walked out on to the cliffs, and, there reclining, gazed on the sea, &amp; held discourse on many things. As we returned, the sky was alive with aeroplanes. The Sunday paper contains very good news from the seat of War, where the Germans are still being hustled, &amp; driven back with heavy losses both in prisoners and in material.</hi>
