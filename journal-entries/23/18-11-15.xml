<hi>I spent the day writing a sermon for next Sunday's service in the Cathedral. Moore<persName xml:id="4331"></persName>, Knight<persName xml:id="62"></persName>, &amp; Treherne<persName xml:id="4426"></persName> in succession came to see me. In very different ways they are rather conspicuous among the parochial clergy. In the evening <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I attended a meeting of women in the Town Hall convened to discuss the responsibilities of the woman voter. Miss Rosamund Smith of London was the principal speaker. She was not very interesting or informing. I also spoke, &amp; so we ended. It is an odd reflection that after having publicly and privately, opposed female suffrage, and being myself still wholly unchanged in my judgment on that question, I should yet be asked to address assemblies of women on their political responsibilities.</hi>
