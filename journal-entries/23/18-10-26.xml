<hi>I copied out the sermon published in "Westminster Sermons", and adapted it for use in the cathedral tomorrow. At 12.30 noon I went across to the cathedral, and instituted 3 incumbents. After lunch I walked with <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName>, and called on old Prebendary Palmer<persName xml:id="4349"></persName>, &amp; the Mayor<persName xml:id="4212"></persName>.</hi>

<hi rend="italic bold underline">There are now two vacant canonries at Westminster Abbey. If Ernest<persName xml:id="636"></persName> goes to a bishoprick, there will be three. The whole character of that foundation may be suddenly transformed. It is in view of such contingencies that the dualism of the Church of England becomes painfully apparent. Over &amp; beyond the change of personnel there is the alternation of mutually contradictory versions of Christianity. That there exists a large mass of well&#8211;meaning but muddle&#8211;headed Churchmen who either can't or won't perceive this inner incoherence, does not in the long run either alter the fact, or diminish its ill consequences. Within the next few months Westminster Abbey may cease to be a citadel of Protestant Religion and become a fortress of Sacerdotalism</hi><hi rend="i bold">!</hi>
