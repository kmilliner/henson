<hi>This day was frittered away in the solemn trifling which is grandly described as "episcopal work". Hardly had I settled myself in my study before the Archdeacon of Hereford<persName xml:id="4450"></persName> appeared, &amp; held me with a mass of what he calls "business" until <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName> came to settle about the functions next Sunday, and then I had a meeting of the Hereford Schools Association. Lunch was hastily consumed, &amp; then came another meeting – the Church Building Association – followed by the Board of Finance. Hardly had I emerged from these meetings before I had to face the lady correspondent of the School at Ashperton, who came with a perfect Baruch&#8211;roll of complaint against the Vicar of that parish, a man</hi> <hi rend="underline">named</hi><hi> Randle<persName xml:id="4658"></persName>. I wrote many letters, and charged Norcock<persName xml:id="4345"></persName> to write many more.</hi>
