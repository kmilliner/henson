<hi>I motored to Eardisley, and there attended a meeting of the clergy of the Weobley Rural Deanery. We began with a short service in the Church conducted by the Rural Dean (</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Montgomery Campbell</hi><persName xml:id="4634"></persName><hi>): and then we discussed the place of the Holy Communion in the services of Sunday. There were 14 clergy present including</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Compston</hi><persName xml:id="2010"></persName><hi>, and all talked, but with no great ability. They are mortally stale through solitude, &amp; lack of adequate employment. After lunch</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Campbell</hi><hi> and I motored to Lyonshall, and called on the Vicar (</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Pemberton</hi><hi> ) who is about to leave the diocese. Then we went on to Weobley &amp; had tea with M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Beattie</hi><persName xml:id="4507"></persName><hi>, an exceptionally attractive lady with a delightful family. She shewed us the fine parish church, and the picturesque village. Then we motored to Hereford. I wrote to <persName xml:id="4506">Beattie</persName>, and to Knight<persName xml:id="62"></persName>. Also to an inquirer about marriage with a deceased wife's sister.</hi>
