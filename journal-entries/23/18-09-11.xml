Was there ever a life more given to others, and more empty of every self&#8211;indulgence? It is 22 years since she died, and I feel still the pang of a grief which was half resentment. That, and the death of my poor little infant, perished ere it lived, have left indelible scars of sorrow and rage on my heart. I cannot get over these tragedies. They seem to focus the misery of the world. How different might my life have been if the child had lived! Now I must needs live "from hand to mouth".</hi>

<hi rend="italic">I breakfasted pleasantly in the Club<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName> with Newbolt<persName xml:id="3946"></persName>, and then attended the meeting of the Committee at Westminster.
