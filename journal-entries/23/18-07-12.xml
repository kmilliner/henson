<hi>The morning was spent at the Palace mostly in clearing off correspondence, &amp; preparing notes for my address on Sunday. I lunched alone, as <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> had gone to open some Sale of Work. Then I motored to Staunton&#8211;on&#8211;Wye, &amp; attended the meeting of the Jarvis Trustees<orgName xml:id="313"></orgName>. There was only formal business, &amp; my time was wasted.</hi>

In common with others of the bishops I deprecate the speech he made, &amp; regret he was allowed to do more than present the petition entrusted to him. The line taken is in my judgement lowering to the dignity &amp; influence of the Church. This or course requires no reply, but I wish to deliver my soul as the oldest in years of the bishops on the bench".</hi>
