<hi>I had my hair cut, &amp; then walked into the City &amp; called at S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Paul's Deanery, but to no purpose as Ralph<persName xml:id="427"></persName> was out, and Kitty<persName xml:id="1209"></persName> was taking a day in bed. I lunched at the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName> with Newbolt<persName xml:id="3946"></persName>, and then walked to Westminster for the Church &amp; State Committee.<note xml:id="351" n="1"></note> The Bishop of Manchester<persName xml:id="242"></persName> moved an amendment in favour of the Baptismal Franchise. There was much discussion, and the debate was adjourned. The Bishop of Oxford<persName xml:id="49"></persName> spoke strongly against, the Bishop of Norwich<persName xml:id="1816"></persName> as strongly for. Temple<persName xml:id="1173"></persName> &amp; Parmoor<persName xml:id="1736"></persName> were also on that side. It was "pretty" to see Gore &amp; his strenuous neophyte Temple on opposite sides. I dined with the Baker&#8211;Wilbrahams<persName xml:id="1427"><persName xml:id="1428"></persName></persName> at 76 Elm Hill Gardens, S.W.10. As I emerged from South Kensington I was seized upon by D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Troutbeck<persName xml:id="2132"></persName>, who was just getting off by the train eastwards. At dinner were a brother of mine hostess in khaki, Miss Rhoda Williams<persName xml:id="4880"></persName>, a daughter of the redoubtable baronet<persName xml:id="1552"></persName> &amp; an ardent advocate of "Life &amp; Liberty",<note xml:id="399" n="1"></note> M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Oldham, M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Parry, a son of the old bishop of Dover<persName xml:id="4650"></persName>, who confirmed me, and Joyce Baker&#8211;Wilbraham. We had a very free &amp; friendly talk about ecclesiastical matters.</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Parry said that he had met me in Rome in 1886, when Headlam<persName xml:id="552"></persName> &amp; I were there, &amp; that he had asked Headlam who was the wonderful schoolboy he had with him, &amp; had been greatly amazed when he heard that I was a Fellow of All Souls!</hi><hi> On my way back to Suffolk Street, Lang<persName xml:id="130"></persName> got into the carriage, &amp; travelled with me for the length of two stations. I looked in at the Club, but there were no telegrams.</hi>
