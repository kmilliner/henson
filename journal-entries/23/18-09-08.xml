<hi>That such a ministry as mine should be entrusted to such a man as I am may well fill me with terror for myself, and not less for the Church.</hi> <hi rend="underline">"We have the treasure in earthern vessels"</hi><hi> said </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">S. Paul</hi><hi> : and asked sadly, </hi><hi rend="underline">"Who is sufficient for these things?"</hi><hi> But he could add with consoling audacity, </hi><hi rend="underline">"If God be for us, who is against us?"</hi><hi> The Collect for today begins by invoking Divine mercy on the Church, then pleads the weakness of individual Christians and prays Divine protection for them.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">Keep, we beseech thee. O Lord, thy Church with thy perpetual mercy: and, because the frailty of man without thee cannot but fall, keep us ever by they help from all things hurtful, and lead us to all things profitable to our salvation: through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen</hi>

<hi>Who can pray thus with more sincerity than a Bishop? And, of all Bishops, who with keener consciousness of personal need than I? Both Epistle and Gospel are very searching. Thus from the one, the noble appeal of S. Paul:</hi>

         <p>
<hi rend="italic underline">"From henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus:"</hi> <hi rend="italic">and from the other, the grave warning of the Lord, </hi><hi rend="italic underline">'No man can serve two masters: Ye cannot serve God and Mammon'</hi> <hi rend="italic">Though truly it is not Mammon who is God's worst rival in the service of an English Bishop. Cowardice, sloth, a squalid kind of ambition, secularity in the bad sense – these are nearer &amp; more inconsistent.</hi>

<hi>A wet morning followed a night of rain. The out&#8211;lying corn will certainly be damaged. I celebrated in the Cathedral. After breakfast I prepared notes for my address at Compston's<persName xml:id="2010"></persName> Institution, and then wrote letters. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> James<persName xml:id="4292"></persName> came to lunch, and afterwards accompanied me to Bredwardine. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and Fearne<persName xml:id="3805"></persName> had intended to come, but, at the last moment, the car was found to be punctured, and we had to make shift with another, which had no accommodation for more than three persons besides the chauffeur. So James &amp; I sate within, and Bateman<persName xml:id="4471"></persName> sate in front. In spite of the deplorable weather there was a considerable gathering of the parishioners. The service was, I think, impressive, and I trust it was also edifying. We had tea with M</hi> <hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Williams<persName xml:id="4895" display="no"></persName>, and then returned home through drenching rain. James is an admirable companion for he knows the country &amp; its history.</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">The female churchwarden, Miss Philipson<persName xml:id="4363"></persName>, placed a basket of figs in the car</hi><hi> ; these were enjoyed at dessert. This is a country in which figs ripen freely, but, although there is a large fig tree in the front court yard, we get no fruit. I gave Fearne a copy of my last volume.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">Yesterday's "Times" reports in its obituary column the death of Ernest's<persName xml:id="2841"></persName> father – </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Gerald Henson<persName xml:id="546"></persName>.</hi> <hi rend="italic">He was a large, lazy man, who, having married at a comparatively early period of his life, a lady with property, forthwith ceased to work, and passed through life as a loafer. He did not show much affection for Ernest, who seemed to have no very warm regard for him. But death makes all things look differently!</hi>
