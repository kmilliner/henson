<hi>The news continues to be excellent. Cambrai has been taken by the British, but it has been reduced to ruin by the Germans. The President's<persName xml:id="2814"></persName> reply to Prince Max<persName xml:id="4628"></persName> is sufficiently firm. He tells him that the German Armies must evacuate invaded lands before there can be any question of an armistice: and he inquires what precisely the Chancellor represents. The situation appears to be developing with great rapidity: &amp;, if only the weather will permit campaigning to continue, the German Army may be overwhelmed by a great &amp; even irreparable disaster.</hi>
