<hi rend="italic">Weather overclouded, with occasional showers. Another day was wasted in </hi><hi rend="i bold doubleunderline">the Church &amp; State Committee</hi><hi rend="i bold">.</hi> <hi rend="italic">We carried the Baptismal Franchise by 24 to 18. I spoke in favour with some earnestness, &amp; I think an impression was made. Again, in the afternoon I was in the majority of 27 to 1 which rejected </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lord Hugh Cecil's</hi><persName xml:id="314"></persName><hi rend="italic"> motion to exclude the Incumbent from the chairmanship of the parish council</hi><hi>. I made a speech in answer to him, which was well received. For the rest, I was generally in a minority. I lunched with</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Ernest</hi><persName xml:id="636"></persName><hi> in Little Cloisters. He has been touring over Ireland visiting chaplains. He says there are 115,000 troops in that exasperating country. He had tea with</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Lloyd George</hi><persName xml:id="234"></persName><hi> in Manchester. I had tea in the Club<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, and there had interviews with</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Woods</hi><persName xml:id="4453"></persName><hi>, the Vicar of the Church Stretton, and </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Andrews</hi><hi>, the daughter of the old paralyzed Vicar of Kinnersley<persName xml:id="4497"></persName>. Then I dined pleasantly with</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Henry Newbolt<persName xml:id="3946"></persName></hi><hi>.</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Sidney Lee</hi><persName xml:id="669"></persName><hi> told me that </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Beeching</hi><persName xml:id="208"></persName><hi> was ill; &amp; </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Walsh</hi><persName xml:id="4697"></persName><hi> that the old Bishop his Father<persName xml:id="667"></persName> was gravely indisposed. The afternoon telegrams announce the occupation of Damascus.</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">General Allenby</hi><persName xml:id="4103"></persName><hi> gives the wretched Turks no time to recover from defeat. There is an unconfirmed report that</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Fox Ferdie</hi><persName xml:id="4557"></persName><hi> has abdicated, and that </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Prince Boris</hi><persName xml:id="4514"></persName><hi>"rules" as regent in Bulgaria. Everybody seems to be persuaded that Turkey is about to drop out of the War; and that this double collapse means "the beginning of the end".</hi>
