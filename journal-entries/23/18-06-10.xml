<hi>I made a start with the Oxford sermon, but with very ill success. In the afternoon I presided at the centenary meeting of the C.U. Association in Hereford. The "deputation" was a dull fellow called Archdeacon Rees<persName xml:id="114"></persName>, who made a great point of the proximity of lions to his mission station in East Africa,</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">as if lions were a special hardship endured by missionaries</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> After the meeting I walked on the river&#8211;bank with <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName>. He is evidently thinking more freely than his evangelical masters would approve! I wrote to Cecil Chapman<persName xml:id="909"></persName>, to Gilbert Darwin<persName xml:id="3981"></persName>, and to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>. Also I wrote to Welldon<persName xml:id="114"></persName>, congratulating him on his appointment to Durham.</hi>
