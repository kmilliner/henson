<hi>I prepared notes for my three addresses at Bredwardine tomorrow, and wrote letters, among them one to M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Bishop, whose husband<persName xml:id="4512"></persName>, the Vicar of Cardington in Shropshire, was killed at the front on May 27</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>. In the afternoon I worked at the interminable &amp; very dirty job of getting the books into order on the shelves. Also, I read</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Silvanus Thompson's</hi><persName xml:id="4689"></persName><hi> posthumously published book, "</hi><hi rend="underline">A not&#8211;impossible Religion</hi><hi>"<ref xml:id="1003"></ref>. It is less powerful than I had expected.</hi> <hi rend="italic bold underline">Lord Stamfordham<persName xml:id="3220"></persName> sent me a civil letter acknowledging a copy of my volume of sermons</hi> <hi rend="italic">and Hadow<persName xml:id="3178"></persName> wrote in flatterous terms about it. The episcopal acknowledgements are of the briefest, &amp; most conventional!</hi>

<hi>I went round the garden with Bateman<persName xml:id="4471"></persName>. There will be practically no apples. The mulberry tree has a good promise of fruit. The potatoes under the trees have a poor look, but elsewhere they seem all right. In the glass&#8211;house the tomatoes are beginning to change colour. The Roses are flowering richly. The acacia trees are full of flower. Three white pigeons continue to occupy the dove&#8211;cote. Thrushes, blackbirds, starlings, &amp; some finches seem to be fairly numerous. Four years ago one could have taken pleasure in all these things, but now one is half&#8211;ashamed to enjoy them. The news from the Front is satisfactory so far as it goes. The Germans are again making a halt. Meanwhile the Americans are steadily pouring into France, &amp; they are reported to be excellent fighters.</hi>
