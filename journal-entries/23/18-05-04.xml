<hi>I wrote letters etc. during the morning. After an early lunch I travelled to Bristol, arriving 45 minutes after time. Also I lost my umbrella on the way. <persName xml:id="4449">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName> took me for a walk after tea with the Bishop<persName xml:id="2533"></persName>. We mounted the Cabot tower, &amp; gained a noble view of the City and the adjacent country. We had a good deal of conversation before going to bed. Mine host's experience as Head&#8211;master of Marlborough gave interest &amp; authority to his opinions on all the questions as to the handling of boys in the matter of sex&#8211;training.</hi>
