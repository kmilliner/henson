<hi>We left the Hotel after breakfast, and drove to Victoria. Though we arrived an hour and a half before the train's departure, we found a great crowd of travellers already on the platform, &amp; more arriving every minute. I doubt if we should have secured a seat at all, if a pleasant&#8211;looking collector had not recognized me (though I knew him not), and volunteered his assistance. He had once heard me preach at S. James the Less, Bethnal Green, when Watts&#8211;Ditchfield<persName xml:id="2462"></persName> was vicar, and was eager to claim acquaintance. In the circumstances we travelled very comfortably to Birchington, and were met at the station by Marion<persName xml:id="77"></persName>, who had thoughtfully provided a taxi. So we arrived safely at Canonbury, &amp; after lunch, spent most of the time in watching aeroplanes &amp; seaplanes, which keep the place in a perpetual agitation. The weather was brilliantly fine, and the air excellent.</hi>
