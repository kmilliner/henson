After lunch <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I walked together for an hour. Then I worked at the Advent Lectures.

The question now is whether he received M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Beattie<persName xml:id="4507"></persName> telegram </hi><hi rend="underline">before</hi><hi> he had communicated his change of mind to the D. &amp; C. of Windsor.</hi>
