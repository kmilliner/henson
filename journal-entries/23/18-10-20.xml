<hi>We motored to Tenbury, and there I preached to a large congregation in the parish church. But my sermon was a failure for I was speaking from notes, and the atmosphere was heavily charged with escaping gas. After writing my discourses, &amp; reading them ^for 31 years^, I am greatly embarrassed when I attempt extemporaneous, or semi&#8211;extemporaneous preaching. Nor can I doubt that even for the simplest congregations</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">I</hi><hi> should preach best from MS: but the hustle &amp; bustle of my life makes the composition of written sermons impossible.</hi>
