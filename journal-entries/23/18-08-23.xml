The weather, though still fine, is much cooler. Beyond writing some letters, &amp; reading the paper I did nothing before lunch. Afterwards Harold and I went to Broadstairs, where my childhood &amp; early boyhood were passed. It is greatly changed, vulgarised almost beyond recognition. I passed, unknowing &amp; unknown through the once familiar streets. Only the beautiful little bay with its quaint wooden pier seemed the same: but some fat women were bathing from the beach in the water, &amp; they gave the new vulgarising touch to that scene also! What will the world be like when the much talked of triumph of "democracy" has been achieved? Will there be any corner unspoiled where the eye can rest unwounded, and the heart find solace? A crowded Heaven is an unthinkable paradox!</hi>
