<hi>The drought continues. There is no sign of rain. It is becoming a grave question whether our patriotic industry in the spring will not be outbalanced by the hostility of the elements. I "looked in" at the Council Meeting of G.F.S. in S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Peter's Institute, and said a few civil words to the good ladies. I made notes for the sermon tomorrow night, &amp; wrote letters. Also I looked in at the club<orgName xml:id="318"></orgName>, &amp; read Glazebrook's<persName xml:id="4234"></persName> article<ref xml:id="817"></ref> on the Selborne Report. It has some good things, but is far too friendly. I wrote to Major<persName xml:id="3660"></persName> telling him that I could not legally ordain his friend.</hi>
