<hi rend="bold underline">The special service in the cathedral to mark the beginning of the 5</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> year of the War was attended by a great congregation, and was (as both <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; the Nurse assured me) very impressive.

These happy enthusiasts, who combine their religious ardour with a steady allegiance to the Radical&#8211;Socialist party, are unencumbered by such scruples, and gain great advantage with the multitude.</hi> <hi rend="italic bold underline">But could not as much be said against the whole tribe of so&#8211;called reformers</hi><hi rend="i bold">?</hi> <hi rend="italic">They set themselves to "voice" a vague and diffused discontent, and their words evoke general approbation, and by thus "voicing" the sentiment they strengthen it. To that extent they have a practical effect on the course of events.</hi> <hi rend="italic bold underline">And it must be admitted that persons of my type are as useless as they are unpopular, self&#8211;inhibited from "going with the multitude" although they approve the multitude's avowed destination, and are only uncertain as to its direction</hi><hi rend="i bold">!</hi>
