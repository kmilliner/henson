<hi>I continued my matutinal reading of Cowper's<persName xml:id="4537"></persName> "Task"<ref xml:id="1025"></ref>. In "The winter evening" there is a hostile description of the clerical magistrate:</hi>  
         </p>
<div type="verse">
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">"The plump convivial parson often bears</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">The magisterial sword in vain, and lays</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">His reverence and his worship both to rest </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">On the same cushion of habitual sloth.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Perhaps timidity restrains his arm;</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>When he should strike he trembles, and sets free,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Himself enslaved by terror of the ban,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The audacious convict whom he dares not bind.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">Perhaps, though by profession ghostly pure,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">He too may have his vice, and sometimes prove</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">Less dainty than becomes his grave outside</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">In lucrative concerns.</hi><hi> Examine well</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>His milk&#8211;white hand, the palm is hardly clean – </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>But here &amp; there an ugly smutch appears.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Foh! 'twas a bribe that left it; he has touch'd</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Corruption. Whoso seeks an audit here</hi> 
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Propitious pays his tribute, game or fish,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Wild&#8211;fowl or venison! and his errand speeds.</hi>
         </p>
</div>
         <p>
<hi>Who are the donors of such bribes? Are they poachers? Cowper would hardly desire a brisk enforcement of the Game Laws. Or, does he allude to the complimentary gifts of the local squires?</hi>   
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[144]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Then follows a vigorous indictment of "universal soldiership" as the spring of general social corruption.</hi>
         </p>
<div type="verse">
         <p>
<hi>'Tis universal soldiership has stab'd </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The heart of merit in the meaner class.</hi>
         </p>
</div>
         <p>
<hi>Cowper describes the transformation under discipline of the rustic lout into a smart soldier, and the disgust of honest work which his military life breeds in him:</hi>
         </p>
<div type="verse">
         <p>
<hi>And, his three years of heroship expired,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Returns indignant to the slighted plough.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>He hates the field, in which no fife and drum</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Attends him; drives his cattle to a march;</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>And sighs for the smart comrades he has left.</hi>
         </p>
</div>
         <p>
<hi>His impatience of work goes along with an acquired disgust of morality:</hi>
         </p>
<div type="verse">
         <p>
<hi>'Twere well if his exterior charge were all – </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>But with his clumsy port </hi><hi rend="underline">the wretch has lost</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">His ignorance and harmless manners too</hi><hi> ,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>To swear, to game, to drink: to shew at home</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>By lewdness, idleness, and Sabbath&#8211;breach,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The great proficiency he made abroad;</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>To astonish &amp; to grieve his gazing friends,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>To break some maiden's and his mother's heart;</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>To be a pest where he was useful once,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Are his sole aim, and all his glory, now.</hi>
         </p>
</div>
         <p>
<hi>This is ominous reading just now.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[145]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Cowper's observation was keen and true. He describes the destructive effect of a hard winter on the birds:</hi> 
         </p>
<div type="verse">
         <p>
<hi>How find the myriads, that in summer cheer</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The hills and valleys with their ceaseless songs,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Due sustenance, or where subsist they now?</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Earth yields them naught; the imprison'd worm is safe</hi> 
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Beneath the frozen clod; all seeds of herbs</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Lie cover'd close; </hi><hi rend="underline">and berry&#8211;bearing thorns</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">That feed the thrush (whatever some suppose)</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">Afford the smaller minstrels no supply</hi><hi>.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The long protracted rigour of the year</hi> 
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Thins all their numerous flocks</hi><hi rend="underline">. In chinks &amp; holes</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">Ten thousand seek an unmolested end,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline">An instinct prompts, self&#8211;buried ere they die.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The very rooks and daws forsake the fields,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Where neither grub, nor root, nor earth&#8211;nut, now</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Repays their labour more; and perch'd aloft </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>By the wayside, or stalking in the path,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Lean pensioners upon the traveller's track,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Pick up their nauseous dole, though sweet to them, </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Of voided pulse or half&#8211;digested grain.</hi>

<hi>This description is life&#8211;like, and could only have been written by a lover and student of the country, who could draw on his own observations.</hi>
