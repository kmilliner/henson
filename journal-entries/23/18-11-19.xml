<hi>Canon Talbot Rice<persName xml:id="4659"></persName> left after breakfast. Of the 3 Ordination candidates two "cried off" on the plea of sickness so that only Scott turned up for examination. He worked all the morning, and lunched with us. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Wood Acton<persName xml:id="4709"></persName> called, and had an interview with me. I was interested to learn that she was a member of the Surtees Family, so well&#8211;known in the North. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I "looked in" at the meeting of the Mothers' Union<orgName xml:id="220"></orgName> Council, &amp; I made a short speech. After lunch, we walked by the river. Then I worked at the Anson<persName xml:id="228"></persName> papers with woefully small result. The Archdeacon<persName xml:id="4450"></persName>, who had spent the day at Ludlow, returned to spend the night here.</hi>
