<hi>I called on Watson<persName xml:id="250"></persName> but to no purpose, as he &amp; his wife were on the point of leaving home for Llandrindrod. Then I went to Blackwell's and bought a volume which has gained considerable success â€“ "Eminent Victorians"<ref xml:id="1007"></ref> by Lytton Strachey<persName xml:id="4684"></persName>. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">c</hi><hi>Dowall<persName xml:id="43"></persName> came into the Common Room, &amp; talked with me about the War. He hovers on the brink of "Pacificism". I lunched with Oman<persName xml:id="2141"></persName> &amp; his wife<persName xml:id="2142"></persName>. He is much more cheerful about the situation in France, &amp; says there are not far short of a million Americans on this side of the water. I talked with M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Pember<persName xml:id="937"></persName> &amp; Catherine<persName xml:id="4356"></persName> for awhile, &amp; then took my departure. I put up in Garland's Hotel, &amp; walked to Westminster, where I just saw Ernest<persName xml:id="636"></persName> &amp; Gamble<persName xml:id="249"></persName> in the garden. After dining in the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, I wrote to Ernest.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Pember</hi><hi> told me that she had met </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Madan</hi><hi>, the daughter of Bodley's Librarian<persName xml:id="4621"></persName>, and had heard of her visit to the Temple to hear me preach on February 10</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> last. This girl of 18 was asked how she liked the sermon, and replied, "</hi><hi rend="underline">There is only the Dean of Durham could preach like that</hi><hi>"; she was much astonished to be told that the preacher was that gentleman under a new description.</hi>

<hi>Old </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Henry Howorth</hi><persName xml:id="4593"></persName><hi> laid hold of me in the Club, and, after thanking me for my kindly references to his book in the Edinburgh Article, proceeded to tell me several pointless stories. I found the man a bore, and was at no pains to conceal my indifference to his humour!</hi>
