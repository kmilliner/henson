<hi>A bright but cold morning. <persName xml:id="4501">William</persName> arrived with the motor in good time, &amp; carried us back to Hereford, where I was in good time to receive the Royal Arch Lodge<orgName xml:id="317"></orgName>. They came in to the garden where I made them a short speech, which was responded to by the Provincial Master, Sir Richard Vassar Smith<persName xml:id="4692"></persName>. Then I went to the Bank, &amp; paid in my episcopal income for the quarter less income tax (&#x00A3;735). I lunched with the Brethren in the College hall, &amp; then went to London by the 4 p.m. train. Archdeacon Newton<persName xml:id="4638"></persName> &amp; his sister travelled with me. I arrived soon after 9 p.m., &amp; at once went to Garlant's Hotel, where my room was ready for me.</hi>
