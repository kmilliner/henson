<hi>I turned out the Anson<persName xml:id="228"></persName> papers, and meditated making a start. The whole business looks more hopeless than ever. Canon Talbot Rice<persName xml:id="4659"></persName> arrived about lunch&#8211;time. <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName> came &amp; helped me with letters. Sir Robert Leighton<persName xml:id="4904"></persName> came to dinner, &amp; then we all went to the Town Hall for the Missionary Meeting, which was pr&amp;aelig;ternaturally dull. Both the speakers &#8211; the Bishop of Sierra Leone<persName xml:id="4696"></persName>, &amp; Canon Talbot Rice – had nothing to say about "mass – movements in India" which was the subject announced for the meeting. The Archdeacon of Hereford<persName xml:id="4450"></persName> &amp; Talbot Rice stayed the night. Before going to bed, we had some talk in my study. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Dillon<persName xml:id="4752"></persName>, who had come to spend the Sunday in Hereford, prolonged her visit in order to attend the Missionary Meeting, &amp; was perhaps hardly rewarded for her pains.</hi>
