<hi>Twenty six years ago I was instituted as Vicar in the old parish church at Barking. I celebrated at 8 a.m. in the Cathedral. Three canons and three minor canons, and about 30 communicants. The morning was so wet &amp; stormy that no doubt many were hindered from coming to church. </hi>

<hi>The Military Service made a very modest beginning. There were, perhaps, as many as 200 men, certainly not more. However, a beginning </hi><hi rend="underline">was</hi><hi> made, &amp; that is something. At 11 a.m. <persName xml:id="3262">Lillingston</persName> preached as canon&#8211;in&#8211;residence. He has a good presence, and an unusually pleasant voice. He preaches from notes, &amp; keeps well within the four&#8211;corners of the Evangelical tradition. After service we walked in the Banks, with <persName xml:id="2937">Penelope</persName>. </hi>

<hi>At Evensong the congregation seemed to me very scanty. There is little danger of my vanity being fostered by excessive popularity! However, I preached an old sermon on missions for the benefit of the <orgName xml:id="124">Church Missionary Society</orgName>. </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="2816">Lord</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2817">Lady Londonderry</persName> were in church, and came in to tea</hi><hi>. They made themselves very agreeable, &amp; went over the house, expressing much interest in it. Lillingston came in also. I thought it a convenient opportunity to introduce him to the great people.</hi>

<hi>The day culminated in a d&#x00E9;bacle. When I appeared in the Town Hall at 7.30 p.m. for the 'Sacred Concert', I found nobody there but the performers with the <persName xml:id="2800">Precentor</persName>. About half a dozen men in khaki finally arrived. Col: <persName xml:id="3833">Blackett</persName> was to take the chair, &amp; he appeared in due course. But, of course, it was impossible to go through a programme in these circumstances: &amp; we agreed on a postponement </hi><hi rend="underline">sine die</hi><hi>!! After my return to the Deanery, I wrote to the Mayor announcing this decision, and enclosing a cheque for five pounds as my contribution to the 'Soldiers' Recreation Fund'.</hi>
