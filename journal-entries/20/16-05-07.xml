<hi>A wretchedly depressing day, with much rain &amp; not so much as an episode of sunshine to redeem it. <persName xml:id="2841">Ernest</persName> accompanied me in the car to Seaham Harbour, where I preached to a church full of troops. The service was well&#8211;conducted, and the singing very hearty: but there was much coughing, for many of the men had been on duty during the night, and the atmosphere was asphyxiating so that I preached with discomfort. We arrived back in the Deanery about noon.</hi>

<hi>I attended Evensong, and wrote some letters. After dinner we read poetry in my study until bed&#8211;time.</hi>

<hi>This is the anniversary of the sinking of the "Lusitania": and the world awaits with half&#8211;amused curiosity what reply <persName xml:id="2814">President Wilson</persName> will return to the latest "Note" from Germany in reply to his own.</hi>
