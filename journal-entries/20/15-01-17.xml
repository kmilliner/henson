<hi>A hard frost. The Cathedral was unusually cold when I went into it for the 8 a.m. service. I celebrated myself. The military service was attended by about 1200 men. The <orgName xml:id="283">'Pals'</orgName> Battalion from Cocken came in: a march of five miles, perhaps, is unfavourable to singing. Anyway, the singing was very disappointing. <persName xml:id="473">Knowling</persName> preached an admirable little sermon, which, however, I suspect was not heard by many of the men. At Mattins I preached from the words "Quit you like men: be strong", and discussed the claim of Christianity to be accounted 'a man's religion'. <persName xml:id="3818">Hugh Lyon</persName> came over from Gateshead, &amp; walked with me after service. <persName xml:id="2216">Pease</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3497">his wife</persName> were in the Cathedral, &amp; came into the Deanery. He has just returned from France, where he has been organizing "Red Cross" work. <persName xml:id="3455">Jevons</persName>, M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Iremonger &amp; her boy, &amp; <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName> came to lunch. The absence of the choirboys robbed the services in the Cathedral of much of their attractiveness, though the men made a brave show. Hugh Lyon returned to his billet at Gateshead by the 8.57 p.m. train. I read 'Paradise Lost' to my family until Prayers: &amp; then <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I committed the absurdity of finishing <persName xml:id="3553">Mead&#8211;Falconer's</persName> book 'The Nebully Cost'. This is so far as I am personally concerned the real objection to novels. If once you are fool enough to begin them, you are committed to the time&#8211;wasting necessity to finish them: &amp; as their holding power is in precisely inverse ratio to their intrinsic value, you have to suspend normal activities, &amp; get through with them as quickly as possible!</hi>
