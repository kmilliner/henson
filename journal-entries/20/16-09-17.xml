<hi>The weather was most unkindly, heavy driving rain until far in the afternoon. Betty and her husband arrived from London very late so that there was some anxiety as to my being able to get motored into Glasgow in time for service at 11 a.m. However, we managed the feat, though were nearly destroyed by skidding into the tram&#8211;car as we neared the Cathedral. In spite of the rain there was a large congregation. The new minister D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="3757">MacGibbon</persName> is a rather gaunt&#8211;looking man, typically Scotch. The lessons were read by <persName xml:id="2025">Lord Guthrie</persName> and <persName xml:id="1884">Lord Inverclyde</persName>. I preached in cassock &amp; surplice, as the minister requested. My sermon on "Justice" was mainly identical with that which I preached on Assize Sunday in Durham. The congregation was largely composed of men, many of whom were officers of the Boy's Brigade, which was holding its annual conference under the Presidency of Lord Guthrie. The sermon must have seemed to them rather heavy &amp; irrelevant! </hi><hi rend="bold underline">After service Sir Charles <persName xml:id="230">Renshaw</persName> motored me to the Central Hotel, &amp; commended me to the good offices of the manager</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> <hi>I was accordingly treated with much homage as the Chairman's guest. Indeed a bottle of port&#8211;wine with glass was provided in my bedroom, as the Liquor Board's restrictions prohibited the sale of alcohol in the Hotel on Sunday! This is a spectacle which sets one thinking. After lunch I went to my sitting&#8211;room &amp; read the Sunday papers. I was invaded by a young man sent from the Boy's Brigade Council to fetch me to the meeting in S. Andrew'' Hall. The great building &#8211; floor and galleries &#8211; was entirely filled with the boys: their seniors occupied the platform. I sate next Lord Inverclyde, Lord Guthrie presided, &amp; D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> James Thomson, the Minister of St Andrew's parish, preached. The singing was very stirring; &amp; indeed, the whole service was full of encouragement. I was really pleased to be present.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">Last night I had a dream of extraordinary vividness: it was some minutes before I had wholly persuaded myself that it was indeed a dream. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">The central figure was <persName xml:id="600">Ernest Rudling</persName>, and it so impressed me that I note the fact on the chance that I may discover presently some corresponding movement of his mind</hi><hi rend="i bold">.</hi><hi rend="italic"> Dreams are strange things: the number of dreams which were distinct enough to impress me is very small (N.B. This is worthy of Abp. <persName xml:id="3468">Laud</persName>)</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">I preached in the Cathedral at 6.30 p.m.</hi> <hi>There was again a large congregation, in which I observed a rather astonishing proportion of young men. The industries of Glasgow are of such a nature that the workers are, to a large extent, exempted from military service. The assistant minister read the prayers in the Euchologion rather heavily. We had two lessons which I read; the Magnificat, the Creed, Psalms, An Anthem, and two hymns. My sermon was an enlarged edition of the Windsor discourse. It was very closely listened to. The service occupied just about an hour &amp; a half. As no taxi appeared, I went home by the tram being accompanied most of the way by that odd fish, Professor <persName xml:id="3902">Reid</persName>.</hi>

<hi>The Hotel&#8211;Manager bade me welcome, &amp; gave me supper. In my room I took a glass of port, musing much at the oddness of the procedure, which stamps a frankly normal exercise of Christian liberty with a furtive character as if it were indeed a discreditable action! </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Sir Charles tells me that the amount of alcohol consumed in this Hotel has not diminished in consequence of the total prohibition of the sale of alcohol from Saturday to Monday. Liquor is bought in bottles &amp; consumed ignobly in private apartments</hi><hi>, &amp; probably in many cases more alcohol is taken by precisely the individuals who most need some discipline of restraint. It all seems very absurd.</hi>
