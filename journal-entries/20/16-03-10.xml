<hi>The snow still continues, melting partially during the day, and being renewed every morning; extremely uncomfortable weather. I finished the sermon for Sunday. The copies of <ref xml:id="85">"Robertson of Brighton"</ref> arrived from the publishers. I sent one to <persName xml:id="3462">Lord Durham</persName>, and one to <persName xml:id="1559">Lord Barnard</persName>. The latter wrote &amp; asked me to become a steward at the annual dinner in aid of the Masonic Girls' School. I consented, &amp; sent the requisite cheque for &#x00A3;11.11.0. Had I not been Grand Chaplain I wouldn't have done this. I celebrated the Holy Communion in the morning, and attended Evensong in the afternoon: walked for an hour in the snow, &amp; wrote letters.</hi>
