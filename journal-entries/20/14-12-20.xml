<hi>A calm frosty morning, very cold. I celebrated in the Cathedral at 8 a.m. The grammar&#8211;school boys formed the bulk of the communicants. At the military service there came about 200 men, &amp; it was rather dull. The Ordination went through without hitch: &amp; was impressive enough. The <persName xml:id="2785">Bishop of Jarrow</persName> walked beside me going into &amp; leaving the Cathedral. General <persName xml:id="3223">Gaisford</persName> came to lunch, &amp; stayed to Evensong in the Cathedral. After the service the recently ordained men &amp; their friends came to tea: and I took them over the Deanery. Then <persName xml:id="3230">Streeter</persName> &amp; I went for a walk. General Gaisford came to dinner.</hi>
