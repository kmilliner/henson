<hi>A most glorious morning. <persName xml:id="114">Welldon</persName> discoursed at breakfast about the Masons. He said that in India the society was a great bond of union between Christians &amp; non&#8211;Christians: that he had held services for the members in his cathedral, using the accustomed Anglican forms: that he adopted the same treatment of Nonconformists in this country. But herein I apprehend that he ignores a vital distinction, &amp; goes near to inflicting unwittingly a wounding insult to his fellow&#8211;Christians. The cadets from the school came to the military service. I preached from S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Paul's word: "</hi><hi rend="underline">I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus</hi><hi>". At mattins <persName xml:id="3262">Lillington</persName> preached the second of his course of sermons on "The Death of Christ". It was very crude. I celebrated after Mattins. General <persName xml:id="3223">Gaisford</persName> &amp; his wife were in church, &amp; came to lunch. Also Colonel <persName xml:id="3991">Grimshaw</persName> &amp; one of his officers, a deaf captain. Welldon &amp; I walked round to the school where <persName xml:id="3682">Wilkinson</persName> shewed us the new house. Welldon's sermon was rather a </hi><hi rend="underline">staccato</hi><hi> performance on the woes of children. </hi>
