<hi>At noon there was a memorial service for <persName xml:id="218">Lord Roberts</persName> in the Cathedral. The Mayor &amp; Corporation, the University, &amp; about 400 men of Colonel <persName xml:id="3833">Blackett's</persName> command attended. <persName xml:id="2806">Bayley</persName> lunched here, &amp; afterwards accompanied me to the Chapter House, where I received the deputation of Chapter Workmen. We shall have to raise their wages. Later I attended the Mayor's Committee for Entertainment of Soldiers. We decided to rent the Shakespeare Hall for 30/. per week, &amp; to make use of the <orgName xml:id="239">Y.M.C.A.</orgName> rooms, &amp; the Constitutional Club. Also we decided to form 4 sub&#8211;committees viz: Refreshments with Mayoress for Chairman: Entertainments under the <persName xml:id="2800">Precentor</persName>: Sundays under Dean: Management under <persName xml:id="3693">Caldcleugh</persName>. There is much uncertainty as to the number of men likely to be in Durham, &amp; the duration of their stay here. There is talk of another Battalion coming to Sherburn: &amp; the <orgName xml:id="283">'Pals'</orgName> will continue at 'Cocken Hall'.</hi>
