<hi>A bright frosty morning. I attended the Military Service, and read the Lesson. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3496">Dennett</persName> </hi><hi>preached. The sharp weather has made the coughing fast &amp; furious. Probably he secured as much attention as could reasonably be expected. The men sang "</hi><hi rend="underline">For ever with the Lord</hi><hi>" with some heartiness. That is one of the "undenominational" hymns, familiar therefore to the Dissenters as well as to the Churchmen. I did not attend Mattins but finished the sermon for <placeName xml:id="53">Wynyard</placeName>, &amp; wrote to <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName>.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>We motored to Wynyard but arrived nearly half an hour late for lunch! The party consisted of </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3462">Lord Durham</persName></hi><hi>, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Marriott</hi><hi>, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Walter Long</hi>, M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><persName xml:id="3784"></persName><hi> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Dillon</hi><hi>, &amp; Lady </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="2819">Londonderry</persName></hi><hi>. After lunch we walked in the grounds, and did much talking. At 5.45 p.m. was Chapel service: I preached the dull sermon I had prepared with so much labour. The text was S. Paul's words: "</hi><hi rend="underline">God is faithful</hi><hi>". This connected itself with the Harvest, for which the service was a Thanksgiving, and (less obviously) with Foreign Missions for which a collection was taken. Then we motored back to Durham, arriving about 9 p.m. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> <persName xml:id="2063Guest">Long</persName></hi><hi> spoke very strongly about the ill conduct of the "</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Times</hi><hi>", to which he ascribed the lowering of British credit which expresses itself in the adverse rate of exchange with America. He himself would have desired to suppress the "Times" and the "Daily Mail" along with the "Globe".</hi>
