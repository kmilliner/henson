<persName xml:id="5"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Baxter's</hi> </persName><hi rend="underline">"Holy Commonwealth"</hi><hi> (1619) is curious reading. He says good things sometimes e.g. "It is a </hi><hi rend="underline">dead</hi><hi> Commonwealth that is without the magistrate: and it is a </hi><hi rend="underline">mad</hi><hi> commonwealth that is without a Church &amp; Ministry". He has a touching belief in the civic competence of ministers: "If Divinity be true and good, then certainly the students of it are likely to be the wisest and the best of men: for the object ennobleth, and the employment perfecteth the faculties".

<hi>After dinner Olive sang for three quarters of an hour very beautifully. Her voice has a fulness and richness which are rarely heard in amateurs: &amp; she produces it without any straining, a circumstance which makes audience delightful. Then I read poetry for half an hour; and then two special constables called to warn us that lights were visible from the Deanery. There is so much glass in this house that complete darkening is not very easy to effect.</hi>
