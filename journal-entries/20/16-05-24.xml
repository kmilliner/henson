<hi>I wrote a long letter to Ernest: </hi><hi rend="bold underline">worked at &amp; practically finished the Edinburgh Sermon</hi><hi>: went to the "Empire Day" function at the <orgName xml:id="266">Blue Coat School</orgName>, &amp; made a speech to the children: afterwards called with <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> on <persName xml:id="2693" display="no">Olive</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3873">Caroline</persName>, &amp; saw their babies: also on M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Paine. Then we returned to the Deanery by way of the river&#8211;bank.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">I received from the <persName xml:id="2462">Bishop of Chelmsford</persName> a letter protesting against my reference to him in the S</hi><hi rend="i sup u">t</hi><hi rend="italic"> Margaret's Sermon of May 14</hi><hi rend="i sup u">th</hi><hi rend="italic">, &amp; saying that I misinterpreted his teaching. I replied forthwith, sending an extract from the said sermon, &amp; referring the Bishop to the report of his words in the "Record" of April 20</hi><hi rend="i sup u">th</hi><hi rend="italic"> which (I said) appeared to justify my reference.</hi><hi> Then I went to the <placeName xml:id="74">Wharton Park</placeName>, and there addressed a considerable gathering of <orgName xml:id="193">Boys' Scouts</orgName>, <orgName xml:id="45">Church Lads Brigade</orgName>, &amp; <orgName xml:id="255">Boys Brigade</orgName>, who were parading in honour of "Empire Day". The boys made a brave show as they marched through the town preceded by their Band. They were ranged conveniently in the Rink, &amp; could, I was assured, hear easily what I said to them. Later, <persName xml:id="42">Steel&#8211;Maitland</persName> and <persName xml:id="701">his wife</persName> arrived from London, designing to break their journey to Scotland, &amp; see the Cathedral.</hi>
