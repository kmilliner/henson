<hi>After breakfast I walked along the Embankment to the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName>, and there wrote letters for most of the morning. I called in on <persName xml:id="1289">Reginald Smith</persName> and talked with him for a few minutes. He said that about 600 copies of <ref xml:id="85">"Robertson"</ref> had been sold. This doesn't look like a success! I returned to the Deanery for lunch, &amp; then walked back to the Athenaeum with <persName xml:id="427">Ralph</persName>. In the Club I had speech with <persName xml:id="322">Buckle</persName>, the <persName xml:id="2521">President of Magdalen</persName>, <persName xml:id="1427">Baker&#8211;Wilbraham</persName>, <persName xml:id="909">Sir Lewis Dibdin</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="2143">Firth</persName>. Then I returned to the Deanery, buying some toys for the children on the way. There came to dinner <persName xml:id="3876">Major Carruthers</persName> &amp; his wife, formerly <persName xml:id="1261">Violet Markham</persName>. Also <persName xml:id="1255">Linetta</persName>. All of them rage wonderfully against the Government, but, so far as I can see, for no intelligible reason.</hi>
