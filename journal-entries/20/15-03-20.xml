<hi>A fine day growing colder towards its decline. There was ill news in the paper &#8211; three ships lost by floating mines in the Dardanelles. </hi>

<hi>I presided at rather a futile Chapter: &amp; afterwards looked at the treasures in the cellar in order to make sure that they were not being injured by damp. They seemed all right. After lunch I walked with <persName xml:id="1204">Mary</persName>, probably for the last time as she leaves on Monday. I wrote letters &amp; revised sermons. Prof: <persName xml:id="1862">Bonney</persName> arrived from Cambridge about 6.30 p.m. after a long &amp; tiresome journey. He is hale &amp; cheerful, but much bowed with age.</hi>
