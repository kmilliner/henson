<hi>My morning's reading &#8211; in which none the less I finished <persName xml:id="3811">McKechnie</persName> &#8211; was interrupted by the visit of a parson, who said he hailed from Uganda, &amp; had come to Durham for the pious purpose of visiting <persName xml:id="555">Bishop Tucker's</persName> grave. I asked him to lunch, &amp; we had an agreeable tête&#8211;&#x00E0;&#8211;tête, as <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> kept her bedroom with a cold. I attended Evensong in the Cathedral, &amp; after the service we motored to Sunderland, where I dined with the <persName xml:id="3992">Mayor</persName> and M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Richardson, and then delivered a Magic&#8211;lantern&#8211;Lecture on my visit to the Yellowstone Park in the Subscription Library Hall. There was a fair assembly, &amp; the proceeds were devoted to the Local Relief Fund. I returned to Durham immediately after the Lecture, and arrived in the Deanery about 10.15 p.m. Then I 'mooned away' a couple of hours, &amp; so to bed.</hi>
