<hi>When I came to my study about 8 a.m. I was impressed by the sound of guns, which I immediately surmised to be from the sea. Later in the day, my surmise was confirmed. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">A German squadron had bombarded the Hartlepools, Whitby, &amp; Scarborough, inflicting considerable loss of life on the civilian population, and doing much damage to property</hi><hi>.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>At first we were encouraged to believe that the enemy had been attacked &amp; sunk, but later information dispelled our hopes, &amp; we learned with surprise &amp; humiliation that the German ships succeeded in returning to their own ports unscathed! This will put heart into the German people, &amp; give a plausible text for much official lying. I signalized the occasion by buying from <persName xml:id="3747">Rushworth</persName> several pieces of furniture!!</hi>
