<hi>A bright day but very warm. A bad headache, probably the result of yesterday's travelling, bothered me all the morning. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I walked on the shore. It gave food for thinking to observe the avenues through the cliffs from the beach all guarded with barbed&#8211;wire defences! I wrote to Arthur. After lunch I sate in the garden, and made a start with the book which <persName xml:id="3262">Lillington</persName> gave me some while ago, and which I have never yet found time to read. It is called <ref xml:id="813">'Belief &amp; Practice'</ref>: &amp; the author, 'Will Spens M.A' is a Cambridge don. In the Preface he explains his volume as 'the outcome of a suggestion that he should throw into the form of lectures the substance of a variety of conversations concerning institutional religion'. The style is heavy, &amp; rather pedantic: the manner rather pompous: &amp; the argument less original than it claims to be. Perhaps the thunderous atmosphere hardly assisted me to do justice to the Author or to his work.</hi>
