<hi>A dull day &amp; raining from start to finish, infinitely depressing. The Chapter at 11 a.m. was a small one, the Bishop &amp; <persName xml:id="3262">Lillingston</persName> being absent, but we got through a lot of business. </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="3444">Macartney</persName></hi><hi> attended &amp; made report on the vaulting. We sanctioned his proposal, &amp; accepted </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="3526" display="no"><persName xml:id="3526" display="no">Gaymer's</persName></persName></hi><hi> estimates of some &#x00A3;3000. Then we appointed two beadsmen&#8211; </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="3693">Caldcleugh</persName></hi><hi> &amp; </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="3983">Mowbray</persName></hi><hi>.<note xml:id="268" n="1"></note> I undertook to write formally to </hi><hi rend="underline">Miss Crawhall</hi><hi>, thanking her for the books. Then I called attention to the state of the muniments in the Treasury, &amp; moved this resolution, which was passed: "</hi><hi rend="underline">That a small Committee be appointed to ascertain the best means of arranging and cataloguing the documents now kept in the Treasury, &amp; to report to the Chapter on March 6</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="underline">: and that this C</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">tee</hi><hi rend="underline"> make a list of such MSS. &amp; Seals as may seem suitable for exhibition in the Library, &amp; present it for the consideration of the Chapter</hi><hi>." The C</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">tee</hi><hi> was ordered to consist of the Dean &amp; <persName xml:id="1898">Treasurer</persName> with the <persName xml:id="2953">Librarian</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2806">Bayley</persName>. It was also agreed to remove the Cuthbert Relics &amp; other treasures from the Library to a safer place. Bayley, <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName> &amp; I did effect such removal, placing the treasures in the Deanery cellar, &amp; depositing the key thereof in the college safe. </hi>
