<hi>The weather has been bright, and somewhat colder, a welcome change from the warm &amp; windy days of the last fortnight. I spent the morning in taking the </hi><persName xml:id="574"><hi rend="underline">Burkitts</hi></persName><persName xml:id="573"></persName><hi> over the Cathedral and the Castle. After lunch I distributed prizes to the <orgName xml:id="270">Choir School</orgName> in the Chapter House, and then attended Evensong. Later, I took </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Burkitt</hi><hi> to see old </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3628">Greenwell</persName></hi><hi>, whom we found a very amiable &amp; conversational mood. He says that a cast has been made of the famous Bewcastle Cross, &amp; promised to send me the address of the Society from which it could be obtained. Neither the Spectator nor the Nation has any reference to my letter on the "Total Abstinence" crusade. This can hardly be unintentional, &amp; perhaps discloses a measure of embarrassment. </hi><hi rend="underline">S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi rend="underline"> Loe <persName xml:id="1399">Strachey</persName></hi><hi> would hardly like to denounce me: yet he could do nothing else if he were to refer to the subject. </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="473">Knowling</persName></hi><hi> and </hi><hi rend="underline">Miss <persName xml:id="3895">Tristram</persName></hi><hi> came in to dine. The latter had been formerly acquainted with </hi><hi rend="underline">M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi rend="underline"> Burkitt</hi><hi>. Later </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="206">Baddeley</persName> </hi><hi>arrived from London to spend the week&#8211;end. He reports that <persName xml:id="3931">his sister</persName>, who was to have been married last week, is still a virgin, having gone into hospital for some small operation, and being there still. This has an unfortunate sound.</hi> <hi rend="italic underline">M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">rs</hi><persName xml:id="3813"><hi rend="italic underline"> Darwin</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> sent me a note to say that her husband &amp; she agreed cordially with <ref xml:id="874">my letter</ref> in the "Times". I take </hi><persName xml:id="3512"><hi rend="italic underline">Colonel Darwin</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> to be a representative English gentleman, of religious profession and regular habits. </hi><hi rend="italic underline">M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">r</hi><hi rend="italic underline"> Horsley</hi><hi rend="italic">, the manufacturer whom </hi><hi rend="italic underline">A. L. <persName xml:id="1170">Smith</persName></hi><hi rend="italic"> commended specially to my regard, also wrote to express agreement. He again is a representative man. </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Sir George <persName xml:id="2735">Askwith</persName></hi><hi rend="italic"> writes to the same effect as one who has exceptional knowledge of the working classes. I find it difficult to believe that a policy which offends all these men can be either prudent, or just.</hi>
