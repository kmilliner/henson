<hi rend="underline">M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><persName xml:id="3795"><hi rend="underline"> Watts</hi></persName><hi>, the curate of one of the hamlets near Durham, called on me with respect to arranging entertainments &amp;c for the Durham recruits at Cocken. I did not receive him very sympathetically for I am rather sceptical as to the real value of all the fussy private effort which the war has generated. However I wrote to </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="3462">Lord Durham</persName></hi><hi> on the subject offering to do anything in our power, if the authorities can provide a room. Also I called on the patriotic bootmaker </hi><persName xml:id="3559"><hi rend="underline">Thwaites</hi></persName><hi>, who is now busy with the organising of more recruit meetings. I attended Evensong in the Cathedral, &amp; took Logic for a walk afterwards. </hi><persName xml:id="3585"><hi rend="underline">Boutflower</hi></persName><hi>, the new master of Sherburn, lunched here with his wife. He is rather perturbed at the situation in the Hospital. Evidently, matters are out of hand. I gathered that he also was embarrassed by </hi><persName xml:id="590"><hi rend="underline">iste archidiaconus</hi></persName><hi>: &amp; begins to realize that everybody privily works for him, &amp; with him! </hi><persName xml:id="3470"><hi rend="underline">Sykes</hi></persName><hi> from S.
