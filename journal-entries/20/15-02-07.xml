<hi>I preached to the troops at the Church Parade. They were, perhaps, somewhat more attentive than usual, but there were many bad coughs. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Indeed, an epidemic of influenza is reported from some of the camps</hi><hi>. At Mattins <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName> preached: I celebrated the Holy Communion afterwards. The rain began to fall heavily during the afternoon, and continued without intermission. I attended Evensong in the cathedral, when Boyce's fine anthem, 'Where shall wisdom be found', was excellently sung. Then I motored to Bishop Auckland, &amp; there preached in the parish church of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Andrew (South Church). In spite of the wretched weather there was a considerable congregation. The church itself is a large Gothic building, once served by a college of priests. The rain fell in torrents as I motored back to Durham, where I arrived about 8.45 p.m.</hi>
