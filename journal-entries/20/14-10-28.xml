<hi>I wasted my whole morning in cleaning up my study &#8211; an Augaean stable! Then I attended a meeting of the Relief Committee, &amp; had sight of M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Caradog James, who has volunteered to act as inspector. I attended Evensong in the Cathedral; &amp; then had an interview with M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Henderson, one of the Churchwardens of Spennymoor, who wished to lay before me some considerations as to the type of clergyman needed there. I am afraid he didn't get much beyond the two points (&#x3B1;) that a wife was desirable: &amp; (&#x3B2;) that a preacher was essential. The population is stated to number 5760: the income to be &#x00A3;320 with house: &amp; the single church to accommodate 400 people. There are several Methodist chapels, not well&#8211;attended: but the most part of the people go nowhere. This is not a very agreeable picture of a parish which is said to have been rather exceptionally well&#8211;worked.</hi>
