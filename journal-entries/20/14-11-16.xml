<hi>I walked into the city and had some talk with <persName xml:id="3559">Thwaites</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3693">Caldcleugh</persName> with reference to the meeting which the mayor has convened for tomorrow evening in order to concert some scheme of recreation etc. for the soldiers. Then I went to the North Road, and looked at the Shakespeare Hall, which is suggested as a suitable place for a Soldiers' Institute. </hi>

<hi>In the evening I went to Newcastle, and addressed a meeting in the Town Hall in the interest of a 'Patriotic League of Honour'. There had been expectation that the soldiers would attend in numbers; but this was not fulfilled. A sudden alarm of invasion had caused all the men to be hurried out to the trenches. <persName xml:id="1814">Moore Ede</persName>, the Dean of Worcester, and M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Despard (sister of <persName xml:id="3642">Sir John French</persName>) also spoke. The latter who is a militant Suffragist has a fanatical appearance.</hi>
