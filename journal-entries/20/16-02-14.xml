<hi>The weather has become wintry. Today we oscillate between sunshine and blizzards. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I spent the morning in revising the proofs of the <ref xml:id="85">Robertson booklet</ref>, and in writing a short preface for it</hi><hi>. These I sent to the publisher. After lunch we journey to <placeName xml:id="53">Wynyard</placeName>, by railway to Stockton, and thereafter by cab. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Saunders the wife of <persName xml:id="508">Balfour's</persName> erstwhile secretary was also staying in the house. <persName xml:id="2819">Lady Londonderry</persName> seemed very vigourous, &amp; talked with much vivacity. There came to dinner only <persName xml:id="1659">Col:</persName> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Rowland <persName xml:id="2981">Burdon</persName>, and Capt</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi><hi> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Appleby. Our conversation was as political, vehement, &amp; futile as might be expected. Into the general chorus of denunciation of the artisans for corruption, jobbery &amp;c &amp;c I interposed some observations on their success in following the precedents set them by the classes who had preceded them in the exercise of political functions! This was a novel, and not very palatable, point of view, but it could not be, and was not, disputed. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">Lang had been staying at Wynyard when he came to address the <orgName xml:id="207">C.E.M.S.</orgName> in Stockton. It is characteristic of that saintly man to pitch his tent within aristocratic houses! I must needs take note of the fact that he has been able to visit both <placeName xml:id="62">Lumley</placeName> and Wynyard though his exacting engagements do not allow him to visit Durham</hi><hi rend="i bold">!!</hi>
