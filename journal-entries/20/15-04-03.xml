<hi>An aged, eminent, &amp; immensely loquacious professor is rather a serious responsibility. I took him into the Cathedral, &amp; shewed him its beauties. He expressed a decent, but extraordinarily uninformed &amp; undiscerning admiration. The truth is that he has no real interest in architecture: &amp; churches lie outside the range of his thinking. He was interested in Butler's tablet, &amp; acknowledged that Gladstone's epitaph was good, but this acknowledgement was evidently grudging, for how could </hi><hi rend="underline">he</hi><hi> rightly see any good in that quarter? Cuthbert &amp; Bede didn't stir him in the least, &amp; the Gallilee [sic] appeared to make no impression. But he grasped the "Times" with real fervour, &amp; talked with extraordinary vigour on its contents! I attended Evensong. The "Hallelujah Chorus" was very well sung, &amp; was very welcome. I had letters from <persName xml:id="1204">Mary</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1696">Olive</persName>: &amp; wrote to <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName>. <persName xml:id="3818">Hugh Lyon</persName> came to spend Sunday here before going to the front.</hi>
