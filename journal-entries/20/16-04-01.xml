<hi>A glorious spring morning with much hilarity among the birds that sing, &amp; marked emphasis in the raucous communings of the rooks. I received the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. <persName xml:id="3496">Dennett</persName> was the celebrant. A reporter came to inquire whether there would be anything about the War in my sermon at <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> tomorrow morning. I was able to assure him that there would be no such dilution of the Gospel! </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I read through <persName xml:id="2841">Ernest's</persName> essay</hi><hi> on "A London &amp; a Parisian Lodging House", in which he compares Dickens &amp; Balzac. It is quite a respectable piece of work, and gives one a better impression of his powers than the little sermons. Taken along with his evident devotion to Shakespeare, might one discern a potency of literary competence in him? I presided at a meeting of Chapter. There was little business, but the </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Chapter Clerk was instructed to write to the Mayor, &amp; require some answer to my letter about his bad work in <placeName xml:id="73">Langley House</placeName></hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> I worked awhile in the garden. <persName xml:id="3818">Hugh Lyon</persName> arrived after lunch, and walked round Houghall with me, returning just too late for Evensong. The Bishop came in at tea&#8211;time: I gave him <persName xml:id="2166">S&#x00F6;derblom's</persName> letter to read, &amp; the book on <ref xml:id="805">"Degenerate Germany"</ref>. There was another Zeppelin raid last night. This arrested the running of trains, &amp; delayed the arrival of newspapers until the afternoon. I wrote to Mary <persName xml:id="1204">Radford</persName> congratulating her on the safe arrival of the <persName xml:id="3886">boy</persName>, my godson, and asking for exact particulars of name &amp; date for inscription on a piece of silver. Hugh described to us some of his experiences in camp abroad. The rats must be a horrible nuisance. Like all the returned soldiers I have met, he expresses a preference for the French over the Belgians. The latter impress our troops as churlish and avaritious, with a tendency to making money by espionage!</hi>
