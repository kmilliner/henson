<hi>I left Cambridge at 10.17 a.m. and arrived in Durham about 7 p.m. At March I had a wait of an hour &amp; a half. This I utilized by getting an excellent lunch at "Ye Olde Griffin Inn". The views of Ely and Lincoln were superb. The weather was brilliant up till about 2 p.m.: as the train drew towards Doncaster the country was white with snow which was still falling: but there was no snow at Durham.</hi>
