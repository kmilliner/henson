<hi>A bright, beautiful morning, but leading in a comfortless gusty day interrupted with rain showers. There was an unusually large muster of troops at the Church Parade, &amp; accordingly papers of the service ran short. The <persName xml:id="2785">Bishop of Jarrow</persName> gave the address in the teeth of much coughing. The service which followed occupied rather more than two hours, so that we were on duty from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. â€“ too long for the health of the choirboys &amp; the edification of their seniors. The congregation was very small, a fact which I incline to attribute to the superior attractions of the "Three Hours Devotions", which are arranged at two of the parish churches. At Evensong, I myself preached to a congregation which, though larger than I had expected, was really but small. My subject was "Death"<ref xml:id="893"></ref>, &amp; my sermon unhelpful &amp; dreary. There was a collection for the Serbian branch of the <orgName xml:id="264">Red Cross Society</orgName>. Later I took <persName xml:id="403">Dicey</persName> for a walk in the banks.</hi>
