<hi>I wrote a number of letters, &amp; prepared a speech for the function tonight. <persName xml:id="2806">Bayley</persName> lunched here in order to report his experiences with the three architects last Saturday. I attended Evensong, &amp; then, accompanied by <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, started in our own car with Leak as chauffeur. But he could not get it up to the white gate, &amp; had to leave it at Prebends' Bridge while he returned for the Bishop's car!! We motored to <placeName xml:id="53">Wynyard</placeName>, and had tea with the Dowager <persName xml:id="2817">Lady Londonderry</persName>. Then we went on to the Borough Hall in Stockton&#8211;on&#8211;Tees, where I distributed prizes to the children of the High School, &amp; made a speech. We returned home after seeing the beginning of 'Pyramus &amp; Thisbe', &amp; arrived in the Deanery about 10.15 p.m.</hi>
