<hi>Bright but still curiously cold. I received the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. The <persName xml:id="2800">Precentor</persName> celebrated. At Mattins <persName xml:id="473">Knowling</persName> preached an admirable sermon. The Li&#x00E9;ge Dolphins came to lunch, and stayed until Evensong. I preached the final sermon of my course on Christian Liberty<ref xml:id="907"></ref>. There was but a petty attendance. Bishop <persName xml:id="2785">Quirk</persName> came in at tea&#8211;time to see the <persName xml:id="648">Car&#x00F6;es</persName><persName xml:id="1951"></persName>. We had some talk about the Tower, &amp; concluded that we had best postpone everything until after the War. I wrote to <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName>: &amp; walked with Car&#x00F6;e. After dinner we made a circle round the drawing&#8211;room fire, and talked until bed&#8211;time. In no respect does the smallness of Durham appear more evident than in the absence of employment on Sunday evening. There is really nothing to be done with the Cathedral then, for the little city is full, over&#8211;full, of parish churches, &amp; Dissenting Bethels. These are said to be fairly well attended in the evening, though on any showing the majority of Dunelmians are habitual Sabbath&#8211;breakers. </hi>

<hi>Car&#x00F6;e suggests that the figures should be placed in the Neville Screen as a War&#8211;memorial to the Durham troops. In the centre would be S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Mary with the Crowned Christ in her arms: on either side, S. Cuthbert &amp; S. Oswald: &amp; then the patron saints of the Allied Nations &#8211; S. George, S. Denis, S. Andrew, S. Peter, S. Gudula, &amp; S. Saba. In the four upper niches, the 4 archangels would be placed: &amp; the smaller niches would provide accommodation for the 12 apostles. Car&#x00F6;e reckons that the cost would not exceed &#x00A3;</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">3000</hi><hi>, and says that he could find a sculptor thoroughly competent to do the work thoroughly. The project has much in its favour. It would be central &amp; splendid. It would be a record of the great crisis, &amp; form an excellent lesson&#8211;book for teaching future generations of visitors to the Cathedral. Both the <persName xml:id="2785">Bishop of Jarrow</persName> and I were attracted by it.</hi>
