<hi>In sheer desperation I sent in as the subject of my lecture on Feb: 16</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> to the <orgName xml:id="287">Royal Institution</orgName> the following:&#8211; "Authors' dedications in the XVII</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> century". I suggested that, if it were considered unsuitable, I should be informed. I attended Mattins and Evensong, wrote some letters, and wasted more than an hour in assisting <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> to entertain <persName xml:id="3740">Lady Lowe</persName> [Low], and the Judge's Marshall. We dined at the Castle with the Judge. <persName xml:id="2920">Gee</persName> and his wife were the only other guests. It was a pleasant little party, and much interesting conversation. I asked the Judge whether I might assume that his profession were now practically of one mind on the subject of prisoners being allowed to give evidence, &amp; he replied that such was certainly the case. He is a Freemason, and has held the more elevated offices. As a member of the same Lodge he had made the acquaintance of <persName xml:id="636">Pearce</persName>, of whom he spoke in the most affectionate terms. We returned to the Deanery at 10.30 p.m.</hi>
