<hi rend="bold underline">The post brought me a very kindly expressed letter from the <persName xml:id="128">Abp. of C.</persName> thanking me for yesterday's sermon, and approving it. </hi><hi>This is magnanimous on his part. For many men would have cherished some resentment against a younger man who had criticized them with as much severity as I have used in the Abp's case. We went to Durham by the morning express. As far as York we had the company of a pleasant Harrow boy who said that his name was Stevenson, that he was a relative of the <persName xml:id="990">Runcimans</persName>. We arrived at the Deanery shortly before 4 p.m. &amp; were welcomed by a thunderstorm. I wrote many letters.</hi>
