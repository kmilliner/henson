<hi>We motored to Christ Church, Sunderland, and there I preached twice, first, to the ordinary congregation at Mattins, next, to a gathering of Freemasons at a special service<ref xml:id="914"></ref> in the afternoon. The weather was most unfavourable. Nevertheless, the congregations were considerable. We lunched with M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> de Plage, a Banker, who is also a prominent Freemason. He has two little boys at Bow School in Durham. We arrived back in the Deanery about 5.15 p.m.</hi>

It greatly pleases the sectaries, &amp; goes far to propitiate that numerous section of the Radical party which regards 'Drink' as the grand instrument of Toryism. I inquired what had been the 'message' delivered by the 'Archbishop's Messengers', and M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">rs</hi><hi rend="italic"> de Plage replied, "O just what we've all heard since we were seven years old. We know it all well enough: the difficulty is, how to do it." I suspect that the good lady gave expression to a widely extended opinion. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">This welter of vehement exhortation leads to nothing.
