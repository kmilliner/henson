<hi>A high wind with a deluge of rain received the morning. It followed a stormy night. This surely is not weather for Zeppelins. I travelled to Oxford by way of Birmingham, arriving a little before 6 p.m., and put up at the <persName xml:id="228">Warden's</persName> Lodgings at All Souls. There were also 'week&#8211;ending' there <persName xml:id="3641">Lord Parker</persName>, and M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="3643">Davidson</persName>, of the Foreign Office. At dinner came also <persName xml:id="3645">Godley</persName> &amp; his wife, <persName xml:id="3888">Heberden</persName> &amp; his wife, and others. Everything was very comfortable &amp; pleasant. <persName xml:id="66">Frank</persName> will make in many respects an excellent Warden, &amp; <persName xml:id="937">his wife</persName> is quite frankly enjoying the situation. But the many &amp; mingled memories of thirty years shadowed me in that house, &amp; I felt a certain embarrassment &amp; regret.</hi>
