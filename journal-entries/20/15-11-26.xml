<hi rend="bold underline">I wrote a little sermon for the troops. We went to <placeName xml:id="62">Lumley</placeName> to dine &amp; sleep</hi><hi>. It is a noble house, and <persName xml:id="3466">Lady Scarbrough</persName> has furnished it in excellent taste. We spent an hour in going over it: our hostess evidently enjoys shewing it, &amp; relating the various legends of the purchases by which it has been filled with beautiful &amp; interesting things. <persName xml:id="3465">Lord Scarbrough</persName> brought with him two soldiers, of whom one, Sir James <persName xml:id="3783">Willcocks</persName>, was most interesting. We had much conversation about the War, the main colour of which, perhaps, was rather depressing.</hi>
