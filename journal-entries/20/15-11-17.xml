<hi>We went to Willington by train &#8211; it is but 20 minutes' journey &#8211; &amp; were there met by the Vicar, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4084">Urmson</persName></hi><hi>, who drove us in a cab to the new Church Institute which had been formally opened a few hours before. Here I delivered an Address on "Some Lessons of the War", speaking for exactly 45 minutes. The audience, largely composed of women &amp; children, listened with the gravity of the perplexed, and the decorum of the polite! There was some delay in our departure, &amp; this was explained by the humourous [sic] circumstances that the 'refreshment', which had been prepared for us, had been privily way&#8211;laid, &amp; devoured by some enterprising bandit! We were motored back to Durham through moonlit roads, and arrived back in the Deanery before 9 p.m. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4053" display="no">Thomas Yeoman</persName></hi><hi>, a son of the <persName xml:id="4086">Banks' warden</persName>, &amp; a student of <orgName xml:id="276">Bede College</orgName>, came to see me before returning to France to his duty in the trenches.</hi>
