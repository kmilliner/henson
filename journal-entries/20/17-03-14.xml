<hi>I received the Holy Communion at 8 a.m.: and read in preparation of a sermon most of the morning. D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Campbell, who was to lecture on 'Food, in connexion with <persName xml:id="3588">Lord Devonport's</persName> rationing rules', came to lunch. Also <persName xml:id="2806">Bayley</persName> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="3829">Low</persName>. The lecture was given in the Town Hall at 3 p.m., &amp; was illustrated with lantern slides. There were a fair number of people present, mostly females. I briefly introduced the lecturer, who held forth for nearly 1 1/2 hours. The lecture was interesting &amp; informing in no common degree. Later I dined with Colonel <persName xml:id="3652">Herne</persName> &amp; his Officers. The Mayor was also a guest. The evening passed pleasantly enough. His Worship walked with me to the College Gate.</hi>
