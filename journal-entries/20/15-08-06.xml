<hi>Warsaw has fallen at last. The precise circumstances of the disaster are as yet unknown. It is hoped that the Grand Duke has succeeded in withdrawing his armies, &amp; in destroying the immense accumulations of war material in the great fortress, &amp; its companions on either side which must also be evacuated. I shewed <persName xml:id="18">Gerald</persName> over the Cathedral before lunch, &amp; afterwards we attended Evensong, &amp;, as it was the Feast of the Transfiguration, we heard <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName> preach a sermon. Then we walked to Neville's Cross, &amp; looked at the broken cross which marks the battlefield.<note xml:id="76" n="1"></note> </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I sent the MS of that wretched <ref xml:id="850">article</ref> to <persName xml:id="3566">Foakes&#8211;Jackson</persName>.</hi>
