<hi rend="italic">This morning's paper contains an appeal to the Nation to follow the King's example. It is signed by the two <persName xml:id="128">Archbishops</persName><persName xml:id="130"></persName>, </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Cardinal <persName xml:id="1231">Bourne</persName></hi><hi rend="italic">, and the secretary, </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3804">Compton Ricketts</persName></hi><hi rend="italic">. On the other side there is an excellent letter from </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Hugh <persName xml:id="314">Cecil</persName></hi><hi rend="italic"> in the "Times" protesting against '</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Prohibition</hi><hi rend="italic">' in the name of liberty. I led </hi><persName xml:id="403"><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Dicey</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> in the teeth of a furious gale to see the Choirboys' sports. Then I went to Newcastle, in order to dine with <persName xml:id="3553">Meade&#8211;Falkner</persName>, &amp; be shown the Elswick Works. He met me at the station, &amp; took me to the Club where we dined. Sir Percy <persName xml:id="4009">Girouard</persName> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">r</hi> <hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="4010">West</persName> (the chief shell&#8211;manufacturer) also dined. We drank champagne in spite of the King's Example, &amp; I observed that a company of soldiers were doing the same. Possibly they also await the decision of the Government. After dinner we motored to the works, &amp; for two hours I was conducted through immense workshops &#8211; more than 1000 feet long &#8211; all crowded with machines, &amp; working night &amp; day in the manufacture of every variety of shell. I observed the large number of girls &amp; women employed. The elaborate provisions for testing the shells were explained to me. I came back to Durham by the midnight train.</hi>
