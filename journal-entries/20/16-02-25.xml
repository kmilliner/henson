<hi>The Bishop of Newcastle (D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="1980">Wild</persName>) and <persName xml:id="1981">his wife</persName> came to lunch, and afterwards went round the Abbey with me. It appears that we met them in <persName xml:id="2511">Hutton's</persName> rooms some few years since: but I have no clear recollection of the fact, though the occasion is in my mind. He is a less imposing man than I had assumed him to be, &amp; hardly gives me the impression of strength.

M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Wild (erstwhile Miss Severn) seems an agreeable lady.
