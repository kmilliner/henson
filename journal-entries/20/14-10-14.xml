<hi>I bade mine host farewell, and returned to Durham. The station&#8211;master at Manchester came to me as I sate in the train awaiting its start, and said that he had been in the Cathedral on Sunday afternoon, &amp; that the Railwaymen had been much impressed by the sermon. At Durham I was joined by Gee, a nephew of the <persName xml:id="2920">Principal</persName>, whom I had invited to the Deanery. I attended the trial of three candidates for the lay&#8211;clerkship vacated by Akeroyd's resignation. We elected Gregory from King's, Cambridge.</hi>
