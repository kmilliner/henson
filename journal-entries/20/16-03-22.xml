<hi>I left Durham in a snow&#8211;storm by the 8.20 express, &amp; travelled to King's Cross. My journey was lightened by an interesting conversation with a gentleman who divided with me occupation of the compartment. He said that he was a ship&#8211;builder (if I understood him correctly), and that he was on his way to attend one of the "War&#8211;Committees" convened by <persName xml:id="234">Lloyd&#8211;George</persName>. He said that the wastage of shipping by wreckage had been so much below the average since the war began that the difference had almost equalled the total destruction by the German submarines. Also, that the whole losses so far did not exceed half a year's output of the British yards. On arriving in town, I drove to the Deanery of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Paul's, &amp; deposited my bags. Then I went out, &amp; had my hair cut. </hi><hi rend="italic">After tea, I went to 2. Bloomsbury Square, the rooms of the <orgName xml:id="107">Royal Society of Literature</orgName>, &amp; there read a paper on "</hi><hi rend="italic underline"><persName xml:id="3959">Warburton's</persName> Notes on Neal's <ref xml:id="782">Puritans</ref></hi><hi rend="italic">"</hi><hi>. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Henry <persName xml:id="3946">Newbolt</persName></hi><hi> presided. I dined with the Colquhoun Club at the Holborn Restaurant. Newbolt was in the chair, and there was a fairly interesting company. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="2131">Harold Cox</persName></hi><hi> sate on the other side of the Chairman, &amp; on my other side was </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3710">Ditchfield</persName></hi><hi> the Antiquarian parson. The subject for discussion was "</hi><hi rend="underline">The War &amp; the Universities</hi><hi>". This resolved itself into speculation as to the probable consequences of the War in the Universities of Oxford &amp; Cambridge. Newbolt made rather a wild speech, advocating apparently a "free&#8211;&amp;&#8211;easy" system, by which anybody could read for any period on any subject! I spoke briefly in opposition. Harold Cox pointed out the danger of State control which arose from the probable appeal from the impoverished universities for large financial assistance from public funds. I got back to the Deanery about 11 p.m. </hi>
