<hi>I received the Holy Communion in the chapel at Bishopthorpe. Then I went to <orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName>, &amp; took part in a futile debate on the rubric about the Athanasian Creed. <persName xml:id="2021">Frere</persName> took his seat as a proctor for the clergy. The Archbishop read his decision that, though unbeneficed, he was eligible. I lunched at the Deanery, but the aged Dean did not appear. I came back to Durham by the 4.55 p.m. train. </hi>
