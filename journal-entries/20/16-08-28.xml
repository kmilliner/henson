<hi><persName xml:id="1696">Olive</persName> and <persName xml:id="2659">her mother</persName> went away after breakfast through falling rain. The post brought me a short note from <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName>, saying that he had been suddenly ordered to Salonika: and another from Reggie saying that he had been ordered to France. Shall I ever see the Boys again?</hi>

<hi>I worked at the Article, that is, I read again very carefully <persName xml:id="3066">Figgis's</persName> <ref xml:id="822">"Churches in the Modern State"</ref>, which evidently dominated the Committee. After lunch, <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> walked with me to the Golf&#8211;course, &amp; home through Houghall Wood. Then we attended Evensong: &amp; I finished Figgis.</hi>

<hi>The evening paper announces that Roumania has at last declared War against the Central Powers. This is an important event, and ought to hasten the end of the War. Italy's declaration of War against Germany was announced this morning. 'Ferdie' must meditate a flitting!!</hi>
