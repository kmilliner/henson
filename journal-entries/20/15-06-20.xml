<hi>At 10 a.m. I preached to the troops. They seemed to fill the nave &amp; transepts. Then I attended Mattins, &amp; listened to a sermon from <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName>, which was discursive &amp; characteristic, containing some good things. After lunch I motored to Newcastle, &amp; took part in a meeting in the Town Hall, gathered to discuss the relation of Christianity to the War. The <persName xml:id="1132">Bishop of Newcastle</persName> presided, &amp; there were several speeches, mostly in the recruiting&#8211;meeting style. I spoke for 25 minutes, but not either well or effectively. After the meeting I had tea with the Bishop. He confided to me his intention of resigning his see this year, a fact which I had already heard from <persName xml:id="636">Pearce</persName>.</hi>
