<hi>On Saturday, October 10</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>, I travelled to Manchester in order to fulfil various engagements. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I was hospitably received by Bishop <persName xml:id="114">Welldon</persName></hi><hi>. The next day (18</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> Sunday after Trinity) I preached twice in the cathedral to great congregations. The one sermon on 'Christianity &amp; War' was addressed to Railway&#8211;men assembled for their annual Parade. The other on 'Reaping &amp; Sowing'<ref xml:id="885"></ref> was addressed to the general congregation. On the next day (Monday, the 12</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> of October) I went to Leeds, and there </hi><hi rend="bold underline">attended the meeting of the Council of the Ripon Clergy School</hi><hi>.

On Tuesday (Oct. 13</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>) I went into the city, and had my hair cut in a barber's establishment to which mine host led me. In the afternoon I made a vain attempt to see the <persName xml:id="242">Bishop of Manchester</persName>, </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">and in the evening I delivered a 'Deansgate Lecture' in the <placeName xml:id="61">Milton Hall</placeName>, Deansgate, on the "The Issue of Kikuyu"<ref xml:id="775"></ref>. Bishops Welldon &amp; Mercer accompanied me, and the audience numbered about 200: but not only had the war destroyed all interest in the subject, but also there was proceeding at the time a rival attraction in the form of a great public meeting on "The War &amp; Drink", at which all the Total&#8211;abstinent idols were announced to speak</hi><hi rend="i bold">.</hi>
