<hi>The "Nation" contains an insultingly&#8211;expressed letter in answer to mine of last week from Stewart <persName xml:id="3994">Headlam</persName>. I wrote a brief reply, ignoring the insult, but re&#8211;affirming the essential point. </hi><hi rend="italic">Then Bishop <persName xml:id="2785">Quirk</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2806">Bayley</persName> came to see me about the men's wages. I am opposed to raising them temporarily during the war, because the men </hi><hi rend="italic underline">ought</hi><hi rend="italic"> to bear their share of the general burden: but I think some of the payments are too small. </hi><hi>After the Chapter, <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I motored to Shotley Bridge, where we lunched pleasantly with the High Sheriff, M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="1237">Priestman</persName>, a large &amp; amiable country gentleman. We returned to the Deanery in time for the motor to go to the station, &amp; </hi><hi rend="bold underline">fetch thence Archdeacon <persName xml:id="3997">Westcott</persName></hi><hi>, who is to preach in the Cathedral tomorrow. He is wonderfully fresh &amp; interesting in spite of his deafness. He tells me that he, and two younger brothers were all ordained together by Bishop <persName xml:id="1817">Lightfoot</persName> (who was his godfather) in Durham Cathedral in 1884. It is delightful to note the veneration with which he evidently regards his father &amp; Bishop Lightfoot. Later, <persName xml:id="648">Car&#x00F6;e</persName> arrived, &amp; was full of war, &amp; rumours of wars. He says that Denmark received an ultimatum from Germany at the beginning of the war requiring that she should mine the Belts: &amp; that, under threat of immediate invasion, she yielded, &amp; informed Great Britain of the fact.</hi>
