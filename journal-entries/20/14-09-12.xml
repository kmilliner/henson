<hi>Bright morning &amp; bright news from the front. It really seems to be the case that the great German attack has spent itself, &amp; is now beginning to ebb. The weather worsened as the day advanced, &amp; our open&#8211;air meeting in the Market Place was held under a dropping sky. <persName xml:id="3462">Lord Durham</persName> came to the Deanery, &amp; had tea before the meeting. There was a considerable concourse of men, &amp; of course they were properly enthusiastic. The usual mistake of having too many speakers was made. However, the whole proceedings did not greatly exceed the hour. "God save the King" was very heartily sung at the close. </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="554">Gilbert Simpson</persName></hi><hi> writes to say that he has volunteered for Foreign Service. Also, </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="2936">Jack Boden</persName></hi><hi>, but there is some doubt about his being passed by the doctor. </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="113">Harold Knowling</persName></hi><hi> is with difficulty, restrained by <persName xml:id="601">Sir Kenneth</persName>. There can be no doubt as to the temper of our youth.</hi>
