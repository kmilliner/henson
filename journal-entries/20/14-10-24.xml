<hi>Most of my morning was wasted in writing letters. Then I began to put together notes on the subject of the effect of War on Religion. I attended Evensong in the cathedral: &amp; then walked for an hour with <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName>, &amp; had much frank converse with him. Colonel <persName xml:id="3833">Blackett</persName> called on me to ask my assistance in recruiting for the <orgName xml:id="92">Territorials</orgName>. I promised to do what I could. He is full of indignation because his men have been billeted in the slums of Gateshead, where they are extremely uncomfortable. Vermin, disease, and vice are all residents in that district, &amp; these take kindly to newcomers! Later, I received from the indefatigable <persName xml:id="3559">Thwaites</persName> a letter asking me to assist him in recruiting for the Territorials. I confess to being not a little confused with these district forces, &amp; I am in doubt what precisely I am asking the youth to join!</hi>
