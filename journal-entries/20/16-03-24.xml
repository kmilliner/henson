<hi>I left King's Cross at 10 a.m., and (changing at York) travelled to Durham. I was in the Deanery a few minutes before 4 p.m. My journey was rendered uncomfortable by a severe head&#8211;ache, but it was relieved by a pleasant conversation with a young lady who gave me her name as Miss Jean Crabbe, Duncow, Dumfries. We parted at York very amicably, &amp; I gave her a copy of <ref xml:id="85">"Robertson"</ref>, which I happened to have in my satchel. In the journey from York to Durham I had two companions &#8211; an elderly merchant, and a very young soldier. With both I had much conversation. In their different ways both interested me greatly. His name was Albert R. Twigg &amp; he is preparing for the Wesleyan Methodist ministry. I called on old D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="3628">Greenwell</persName> in order to congratulate him on his 96</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> birthday. He is still amazingly vigourous [sic] in mind. He remembers occurrences which took place when he was 3 years old.</hi>
