<hi>A bright morning. I celebrated in the Cathedral at 8 a.m. using the special prayers issued for the war.<note xml:id="216" n="1"></note> The appearance of the casualty lists gives </hi><hi rend="underline">actuality</hi><hi> to the references they contain to bereavement, &amp;c &amp;c. On returning to the house I learned that another British vessel, the 'Pathfinder' had been blown up by a mine. That form of warfare is the most frightful &amp; disturbing of all; and the Germans appear to make much use of it. Later in the day came news that a <persName xml:id="2814">Wilson</persName> liner had been destroyed by a mine: &amp; that the German had sunk 16 trawlers.</hi>

         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">Bishop <persName xml:id="2785">Quirk</persName> preached his first sermon at Mattins</hi><hi>. He also celebrated. I came in at the back of the Church, &amp; observed <persName xml:id="3496">Dennett</persName> read the Gospel at a fantastic angle. I sent for him, &amp; told him that he must follow the use of the Cathedral. He promised obedience.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I called on J. G. <persName xml:id="3137">Wilson</persName> [John Wilson], and took him for a walk. He looks old &amp; broken. His wife's death would in any case have been hard to bear: but in the present stress of anxiety &#8211; he has a son somewhere in the North Sea on the Fleet &#8211; it is particularly so: &amp;, of course, though his vigour &amp; good spirits make it difficult to believe that he can be so old, he is already past 65.</hi>
