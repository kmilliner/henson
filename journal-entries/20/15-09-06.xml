<hi>I presided at a small special Chapter. <persName xml:id="473">Knowling</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3262">Lillingston</persName> were the only canons present. We agreed that I should arrange with the contractor to have the plaister placed on the vaulting. We had arranged to take our guests to <placeName xml:id="64">Finchale</placeName> after lunch, but the chauffeur whom <persName xml:id="3514">Laidler</persName> sent was totally incompetent, &amp; broke down as soon as we started! So we walked for an hour &amp; a half by the river to 'Old Durham', and back on the other side. After dinner I read some poetry to the company. Faber's "Old Labourer", and Dobson's 'Prayer of the Swine to Circe' were new to the <persName xml:id="2685">Charnwoods</persName><persName xml:id="2768"></persName>. They admired both properly.</hi>
