<hi>A bright uncertain morning, with more wind than is pleasant. I received the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. May was the Celebrant. I made some progress with my sermon for next Sunday, &amp; then wrote to <persName xml:id="554">Gilbert</persName>.</hi>

<hi><persName xml:id="3713">Lady Boyne</persName> lunched here: a beautiful &amp; charming creature. I gave her a copy of <ref xml:id="85">"Robertson"</ref>. After lunch <persName xml:id="1178" display="no">Clarence</persName> &amp; I finished the removal of the ivy&#8211;bound bed. In all we carted away from that bed alone 65 barrow&#8211;loads of soil. </hi><hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="2067">Paula Inge</persName>, my god&#8211;daughter, arrived</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> I reduced my subscription to the "Workers' Educational Association" from &#x00A3;5 to &#x00A3;2. </hi>

<persName xml:id="909"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Sir Lewis Dibdin</hi></persName><hi> writing to me on April 9</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> says:&#8211; "6 Ann. ch. 75 (sometimes cited as ch. 21, but wrongly) applies to all the cathedrals founded by H</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">y</hi><hi> VIII and </hi><hi rend="underline">legalizes such of their de facto statutes as had been in use since the Restoration</hi><hi>. Durham Chapter i.e. the Cathedral on its new foundation was founded by H</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">y</hi><hi> VIII about 1541 (?) [sic] and </hi><hi rend="underline">the P. &amp; M. statutes have been in use since the Restoration. Hence I suppose they now have statutory validity</hi><hi>. I see that <persName xml:id="1736">Cripps</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="105">Talbot</persName> suggest that the 6.Ann. makes the statutes subject to the canons of 1603 because of the mention in 6 Ann. of the "constitution of the C. of E." But the words are "the constitution of the C. of E. as the same is by law established" wh. certainly does not connote the canons. Apart from that I cannot think it consistent with common sense to read so much into the expression "constitution of the C. of E"."</hi>

         <p>
<hi>The notion that our local statutes, having by 6.Ann. full statutory authority, can override the general Canons of 1603 is new to me; &amp; may have some practical importance. In any case, there can be no question as to the binding force of the P. &amp; M. statutes.</hi>
