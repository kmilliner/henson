<hi><persName xml:id="652">Compton's</persName> death, reported in yesterday's "Times", removes one of the decisive factors in my career. For the late <persName xml:id="228">Warden</persName> told me that it was Compton's influence in the "Common Room Meeting" on Nov: 3</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi><hi> 1884 that determined the College to elect me to a Fellowship. What my career would have been if that election had not been made, it is difficult to image. Certainly it would have been less easy at the start, &amp; more obscure in the process. Whether it would have been more serviceable, who can tell? I attended Evensong, and afterwards went with <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName> on a short motor run, in order to test the chauffeurs whom <persName xml:id="3514">Laidler</persName> had sent. We decided that the younger, a lad of 17, named <persName xml:id="4098">Percy Elliot</persName>, managed the machinery best, and accordingly I retained him as driver for tomorrow.</hi>
