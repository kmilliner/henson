<hi>The 2</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi><hi> anniversary of the Declaration of War is being celebrated today with religious services. Our principal function is reserved for next Sunday afternoon, but we mark the day by a celebration of Holy Communion at 8 a.m.; and by special intercessions at Mattins &amp; Evensong. I was the celebrant; and there were about a score of communicants. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="3829">Lowe</persName> brought a party of Anzacs to see the Cathedral. I shewed them round the Church, the Library, the Monks' Garden, &amp; the Dean's Kitchen. They were all Australians, very pleasant and interested, but, perhaps, a little dazed. Then I attended Evensong, &amp; read the special prayer afterwards. <persName xml:id="3512">Colonel Darwin</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3981">Gilbert</persName> came in to tea, and stayed talking for some while.</hi>
