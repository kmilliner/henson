<hi>The snow covers the country. I spent the morning very pleasantly in shewing my guests the Cathedral &amp; the Castle.</hi><hi rend="italic"> After luncheon, I went to the Funeral service of old <persName xml:id="3137">John Wilson</persName>. The main function was in the Methodist Chapel which was densely crowded. I sate in the pulpit. Then, through an immense concourse of people, the coffin was conveyed to S. Margaret's Churchyard. I went in Sir Walter <persName xml:id="990">Runciman's</persName> Car with two Labour members. At the grave&#8211;side I delivered a short oration, &amp; then made my way home. The weather was bitterly cold.</hi>
