<hi>I prepared an address for the Freemasons tomorrow, including in it the following story about the </hi><persName xml:id="3570"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Rev. James Desaguliers</hi></persName><hi>, who ranks as one of the leading organizers of Freemasonary in 1717, when it received its modern form:&#8211; </hi>

<hi>'Being invited to an illustrious company, one of whom, an officer, addicted to swearing in his discourse, at the period of every oath asked D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> D's pardon: the Doctor bore this levity for some time with great patience, but at length silenced the swearer with the following rebuke: "Sir, you have taken some pains to render me ridiculous, if possible, by your pointed apologies: now, Sir, I am to tell you, </hi><hi rend="underline">that if God Almighty does not hear you, I assure you I will never tell Him</hi><hi>".'</hi>

<hi>This story is narrated in Nichol's <ref xml:id="823">Literary Anecdotes</ref>. Vol. ix. p. 641. It may be set beside </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Isaac <persName xml:id="3892">Barrow's</persName></hi><hi> 'score' off the Earl of Rochester.</hi>

<hi>'He was attending at court as the King's chaplain, when he met the famous Earl of R., who thus accosted him: "Doctor, I am yours to the shoe&#8211;tie". Barrow: "My lord, I am yours to the ground". Rochester: "Doctor, I am yours to the centre". Barrow: "My lord, I am yours to the antipodes". Rochester (scorning to be foiled by a musty old piece of divinity, as he termed him): "Doctor, I am yours to the lowest bit of hell".

<hi>This is thus told in the article "Barrow" in the Dict: of Nat: Biog:. Both stories throw a side&#8211;light on the society in which they could be current. The parson now is less of a butt, and more of a nonentity than in the XVII</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> or the XVIII</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> century.</hi>
