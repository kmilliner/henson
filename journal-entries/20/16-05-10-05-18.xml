<hi rend="bold">654</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold"> day </hi><hi>[coincides with Thursday, May 18</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>, 1916] </hi>

         <p>
<hi>Accompanied by <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and <persName xml:id="2841">Ernest</persName> I travelled to London on Monday [sic] the 10</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> <hi>May, and, after seeing Ernest off at Victoria, went to 16 Elvaston Place, where Miss <persName xml:id="2712">Mundella</persName> entertained <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName> &amp; me most hospitably until Thursday, the 18</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> May, when we returned to Durham. On Sunday, the 14</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>, I </hi><hi rend="bold underline">preached in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at Mattins, and in the Abbey in the evening</hi><hi>. Both sermons I prefaced with a short reference to <persName xml:id="109">Archdeacon Wilberforce</persName>, whose death was announced on Sunday morning, &amp; whose funeral in Westminster Abbey we attended on Thursday. Lord <persName xml:id="956">Haldane</persName> dined at 16 Elvaston Place on Friday, the 12</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> May. I had some talk with him during dinner. As we were leaving the dining room to follow the ladies, he detained me for a few minutes to say that he would like to send me a narrative he had prepared of his proceedings from his accession to office as Secretary of War in 1906 to his retirement from the Chancellorship in 1915, when the Coalition Ministry was framed. He pressed on me the private character of this document, &amp; begged me to bring it back to him on the Monday following, when he would be glad </hi><hi rend="bold">[620]</hi><hi> [symbol] to talk it over at tea in his house. The document consisted of 162 type&#8211;written pages, &amp; was of an extremely interesting &amp; outspoken character. He states incidentally that it was written in April 1916 . In the course of this narrative very private documents are quoted, &amp; many intimate communications with eminent individuals disclosed. It is amazingly interesting, &amp; certainly gives a great impression of the Writer's energy, versatility, mental grasp, &amp; far&#8211;seeing patriotism. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Of course it is a personal Apologia by a skilled advocate</hi><hi rend="bold">. </hi><hi>On Monday, the 15</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi>, I went to 28 Queen Anne's Gate, and had an hour and a half's conversation with Lord <persName xml:id="956">Haldane</persName>. This was most informing &amp; interesting. His relations with King Edward VII were evidently most intimate. On Tuesday the 16</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> May, I went to the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName>, &amp;, by arrangement, met the <persName xml:id="602">Bishop of Southwark</persName> there. We conversed for more than an hour. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">In the course of conversation he told me that he was very confident that a Bishoprick would shortly be offered to me, &amp; that <persName xml:id="215">Asquith</persName> had himself expressed his intention of bringing me into the southern Province</hi><hi>. I took the opportunity of discussing the question of my joining the Bench. On the whole <persName xml:id="602">Burge</persName> was not very encouraging as to the possibility of effecting much. </hi><hi rend="underline">qua</hi><hi> Bishop. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">He said that the Archbishop seemed to have changed, &amp; was now generally guided by <persName xml:id="105">Bishop Talbot</persName>. This, of course, agrees with my reading of his Grace</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> I walked in the Park with Lord <persName xml:id="2685">Charnwood</persName>, and had much talk with him. There was a great concourse in the Abbey for Wilberforce's funeral, &amp; the service was very solemn &amp; moving.</hi>

<hi>In the Athenaeum on Tuesday I fell in with Kenneth <persName xml:id="2722">Gibbs</persName>, Archdeacon of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Alban's. He told me that the <persName xml:id="784">Speaker</persName> had offered him the Chaplaincy of the House of Commons in succession to Wilberforce, &amp; that he had declined it.</hi>

<hi>The sermons that </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I preached on the 14</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> were attended by very large congregations</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> In the Abbey the <persName xml:id="128">Archbishop of Canterbury</persName> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="404">Davidson</persName> were present.</hi>
