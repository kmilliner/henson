<hi>The weather has become abominable. Violent wind &amp; rain all day long, and the papers full of storm&#8211;records all over the country. Life in the trenches must be more intolerable than ever, but it stops Zeppelins. I wrote a short sermon for the troops next Sunday, and prepared a special service for next Sunday afternoon. Also, I wrote to <persName xml:id="3462">Lord Durham</persName> inviting him to attend the service; and ordered that muffled bells should be rung on Sunday before &amp; after Evensong by way of homage to those who have fallen in the war. This arrangement is recommended by the <persName xml:id="128">Archbishop of Canterbury</persName>. I attended Evensong, wrote some letters, &amp; did some reading.</hi>
