<hi>I received the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. I wrote a little address for the Troops, &amp; then presided at a Chapter Meeting. We discussed the application of "National Service" to our servants. <persName xml:id="590">W&#8211;ns</persName> was rather offensive. Then I walked to the station, &amp; made inquiry about the box of papers which <persName xml:id="302">Miss Anson</persName> had sent off. I attended Evensong, and afterwards wrote some letters, &amp; revised the C.T. sermon. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">It is far more hard &amp; polemical than I designed or desired: but the more I try to remedy this by inserting mitigating glosses &amp;c, the bulkier grows the discourse without any improvement in its quality</hi><hi>.</hi>
