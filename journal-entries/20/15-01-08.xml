I called on </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="3137">John Wilson</persName></hi><hi>, who still keeps to his bed. But he was distinctly better, &amp; conversed with some animation. We talked about the War, &amp;, in connexion with the inevitable theme, about Labour&#8211;politics. He spoke contemptuously of </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="2404">Keir&#8211;Hardie</persName></hi><hi>, whom he described as a '</hi><hi rend="underline">would&#8211;be&#8211;<persName xml:id="3625">Liebknecht</persName></hi><hi>'. He said that he had no following in England: that it was a mistake to treat him seriously: that all he sought was notoriety. Then the old man told me about his visits to Germany to attend International Conferences of Workmen. He seems to have been favourably impressed by Liebknecht, &amp; much disgusted by the close scrutiny of the German police, under which alone the Conferences were permitted to hold their meetings. He contrasted this with the complete liberty enjoyed in England.</hi>
