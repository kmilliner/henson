<hi>I celebrated at 8 a.m. and I preached to the soldiers at 10 a.m. There were more of them than usual, and they coughed horribly to my discomfiture! </hi><hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="473">Knowling</persName> preached an admirable sermon at Mattins, taking for his text the phrase '</hi><hi rend="italic underline">The life which is life indeed</hi><hi rend="italic">'. I suspect that part of the charm of his preaching is his na√Øve acceptance of the traditional Christian view. He knows no persecution save that of the Roman Emperors: the French Revolution is for him simply an apocalypse of Satan: this War is simply conflict between Christianity &amp; Paganism resurrected in Prussia. Hence his simplicity, fervour, &amp; eloquence. The 'other side' has no existence for him. He ignores it quite honestly because he cannot see it.</hi><hi> I attended Evensong, and afterwards wrote letters to <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName>, <persName xml:id="2128">Olaf</persName> &amp; others.</hi>
