<hi rend="underline">Geordie <persName xml:id="571">Gore</persName></hi><hi> went away after breakfast. I paid the household bills, which show a disconcerting increase. </hi><persName xml:id="3585"><hi rend="underline">Boutflower</hi></persName><hi> lunched here. He wanted to discuss with me the new scheme for <orgName xml:id="227">Sherburn Hospital</orgName>. </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="2841">Ernest</persName></hi><hi> and I walked for an hour in a fair sunshine which was a hypocritical masque of a bitter wind. The choirboys came and sang carols in the drawing room for an hour. We asked the residents in the College, and a few others to come in. I gave the boys severally sixpence, and <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> added an orange, and a Christmas card.</hi>

<hi>The </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="3650">Dean of Chester</persName></hi><hi> has a letter in the "Times" supporting me: and the </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="1816">Bishop of Norwich</persName></hi><hi> sent me his "Charge" with a letter expressing agreement with me on the subject of multiplying bishopricks.</hi>

<hi>I find </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="512">Bishop Hall</persName></hi><hi> so interesting that I waste much time in reading what has no bearing on the purposes for which I am now concerned with him. His opinion of Russian Christians is notable:&#8211;</hi>
