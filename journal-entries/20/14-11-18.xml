<hi>I went into Newcastle in the motor in order to have it examined by the Argyll's mechanics, as <persName xml:id="3513">Cummings</persName> was suspicious of its condition. Leaving the car at their garage under promise of its return on Saturday, I returned to Durham by train. After attending Evensong in the cathedral, and arranging (on <persName xml:id="2920">Gee's</persName> suggestion) for a memorial service in connexion with <persName xml:id="218">Lord Roberts's</persName> funeral, I travelled to Darlington, &amp; there addressed a meeting in the interest of the <orgName xml:id="198">Bible Society</orgName>. The night was very cold, and I had to wait nearly an hour for my train, which was late owing perhaps to the passage of troops to Newcastle. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">When I got out at Durham, I was shocked at the spectacle of a very young trooper in khaki being dragged along the platform in a state of hopeless drunkenness</hi><hi>!</hi>
