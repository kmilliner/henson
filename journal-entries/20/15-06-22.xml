<hi>The <persName xml:id="3129">Duke of Northumberland</persName> and his daughter arrived about 11.45 p.m. [sic] and I shewed them over the Cathedral. They lunched here, &amp; then his Grace presided at a <orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName>. I attended Evensong. After dinner the Committee of Chapter, appointed to consider the question of the Choir&#8211;school &amp; the King's Scholarships, met in my study, and talked hard for 1 1/2 hours. It is not at all easy to settle the conflicting claims of the poor boy and the public school, for the disadvantages of the one almost prohibit competence for the other. </hi>
