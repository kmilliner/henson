<hi>I wrote to <persName xml:id="2128">Olaf</persName> wishing him Godspeed. He leaves for India on Thursday. We motored to <placeName xml:id="63">Ravensworth</placeName>, taking the <persName xml:id="3527">wife</persName> &amp; mother of Col. <persName xml:id="3525">Doyle</persName> with us, and there lunched with the family, and visited the camp in the Park. About 5000 men are under canvas. They will be moved into billets next week, as the weather grows too cold for tent life. Ravensworth Castle is a modern building. In the library I was shown a first folio of Shakespeare, &amp; some good pictures. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went with me to Hetton&#8211;le&#8211;Hole where I addressed a meeting in the interests of recruiting. There was a good attendance of the miners, &amp; close attention: but whether any recruits were obtained I cannot say. We motored back to Durham, and were in the Deanery about 9.30 p.m.</hi>
