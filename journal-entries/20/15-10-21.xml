<hi>I finished Balfour's Lectures. <persName xml:id="2920">Gee</persName> called on me during the morning, &amp; was quickly followed by the <persName xml:id="2800">Precentor</persName>, and <persName xml:id="3856">Canon Martin</persName>. <persName xml:id="4069">Perkins</persName> the newly appointed Vicar of Shadforth, and the <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshanks</persName><persName xml:id="2663"></persName> lunched here. I attended Evensong, &amp; afterwards attended a meeting of the University Lodge of Freemasons, where Whalley was invested as Worshipful Master, &amp; I as Chaplain. <persName xml:id="1559">Lord Barnard</persName>, the Provincial Grand Master, also attended. The proceedings lasted about an hour &amp; a half. It was astonishing how much ceremony &amp; ritual was indulged in. I observed to Lord B. "</hi><hi rend="underline">Surely the English are born Ritualists!</hi><hi>". It is a question how much vitality there is in Freemasonry. For the present, however, I reserve judgement. That the Order is numerous and powerful is not to be denied. </hi>
