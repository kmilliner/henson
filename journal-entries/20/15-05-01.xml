<hi>Dull morning, but warm. I went to the Cathedral for the early celebration. Then I presided at a meeting of the Chapter, at which we appointed <persName xml:id="3664">Hooper</persName> to Bossall, and <persName xml:id="3663">Wright</persName> to Ancroft. A petition from a number of academicks asking that the <orgName xml:id="291">U.M.C.A.</orgName> collection might be continued in the Cathedral was presented: but this I at once took into my own hands as the sanctioning of collections belongs to the Dean alone. </hi><hi rend="underline">We also agreed to give over the Finchale <placeName xml:id="64">ruins</placeName> to the Local Gov</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi rend="underline"> Board. I dislike doing this on grounds of sentiment, but in present circumstances I think it prudent as far as possible to reduce our financial responsibilities</hi><hi>. I attended Evensong in the Cathedral then I wrote to the newly preferred clergymen, and also to <persName xml:id="2920">Gee</persName> answering the petition. Also I walked in a damp mist with <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and Logic.</hi>
