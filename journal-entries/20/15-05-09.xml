<hi><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I rose early and received the Holy Communion together in S. Paul's Church, which we discovered after vain essays. There was a considerable number of communicants: special prayers for the soldiers &amp;c., were said after the administration, &amp; before the Lord's Prayer. At 10.30 a.m. there was Mattins in the Cathedral. I preached<ref xml:id="894"></ref> to a considerable congregation. This is a pleasing church of which the nave is modern, a work of Street's. The Chapter&#8211;house (late&#8211;Norman) is a gem. In the afternoon we were taken by our host to see the noble park, &amp; its fine prospect over the Avon. The river runs through a considerable gulley or canyon, of which the sides are thickly wooded. At tea&#8211;time Bishop <persName xml:id="2533">Nickson</persName> appeared. He is evidently worried by his Ritualists, of whom <persName xml:id="3514">Gillson</persName>, the <persName xml:id="166">Bishop of London's</persName> former chaplain is the leader. Before going to the Cathedral for the Evensong service, <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I called on the <persName xml:id="4018">Dean</persName> – a frail &amp; aged man – who seemed pleased to see us. There was a very large congregation at the evening service, &amp; the singing was very hearty. I preached again, &amp; was listened to with very close attention.</hi>
