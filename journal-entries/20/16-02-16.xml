<hi>A tremendous hurricane lay upon us all day, and worked havock in the Banks. Two of the larger elms were broken, &amp; lay prone. One, hard by the Prebend's Bridge, fell upon a wheel&#8211;barrow which a workman was pushing along the water's edge, and barely missing him, destroyed his barrow. After lunch <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName> and I walked round Houghall Wood. He has manifested some irritation &amp; a curiously unreasonable temper, rather to my astonishment, over the little episode of last Sunday, when I told him that I would myself preach on March 5, as the <persName xml:id="3622">High Sheriff</persName> has requested, when the Judges come to the Cathedral. He cannot dispute that the statutes give me authority to do this, nor does he deny the adequacy of the occasion for an exercise of my statutory power: but his vanity is wounded, and he has indulged in an outburst of feminine irritation!!</hi>
