<hi><persName xml:id="648">Car&#x00F6;e</persName> went off by the 8.20 express before breakfast. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I wrote a little sermon for the soldiers about <persName xml:id="3776">Robertson</persName> of Brighton</hi><hi>. Also I wrote to Smith, Elder &amp; Co. suggesting that they, as the publishers of Robertston's Life &amp; Sermons, might care to publish my Brighton Lecture! Considering my estimate of its soporific qualities this is cool enough! <persName xml:id="3623">Sir Alfred Palmer</persName>, the High Sheriff, came to lunch with his wife. He wanted to talk to me about the vacancy at Heighington. The parish is singularly uninviting from every point of view, but nothing can stay the clerical stomach! There are already many aspirants! </hi>

As he had himself at one time been connected with the paper, he may be supposed to know the facts. When he was a boy, he remembered his father being a regular reader of the "Record" which then appeared three times in the week at a charge of either 1 1/2</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic"> or 2 1/2</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic"> per copy. It contained general news, as well as ecclesiastical, &amp; often formed the sole newspaper of the houses into which it was admitted. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">It was long dominated by <persName xml:id="200">Lord Shaftesbury</persName>, whom the editor interviewed every week. When he (Smith) was connected with it, the circulation was no more than 8000 copies. He agreed that it had now become a contemptible paper</hi><hi rend="italic">. He thought the "Church Family Newspaper" was now the best ecclesiastical organ, though the "Church Times" continued to be the most successful: but the circulation of the latter was to a great extent unremunerative, as considerable numbers of copies were circulated gratis to the clergy in the Colonies &amp; elsewhere for purposes of propaganda</hi><hi>.<note xml:id="299" n="1"></note></hi>
