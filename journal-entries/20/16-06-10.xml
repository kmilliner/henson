<hi>I wrote a long letter to Ernest <persName xml:id="636">Pearce</persName>: also to Lord <persName xml:id="956">Haldane</persName> returning the book (Flexner's <ref xml:id="807">'Prostitution in Europe'</ref>) which he lent me when I was last in London: also to <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName>.</hi></p>

After breakfast I walked with <persName xml:id="2841">Ernest</persName> to D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> <persName xml:id="3752">Stenhouse's</persName> residence, and consulted that good man as to the proper procedure by which Ernest could secure an extension of his leave, if such were needed.

The Bishop addressed the members of the Sunday School Union in the Cathedral at 2.15 p.m. I attended Evensong. <persName xml:id="3818">Hugh Lyon</persName> and his mother arrived at tea&#8211;time. We all walked for an hour after tea. <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName> &amp; his wife, and <persName xml:id="3805">Fearne Booker</persName> came to dinner.

<hi>From the "Spectator" I extract the following, which I hope has been 'read, marked, learned, &amp; inwardly digested' by <persName xml:id="3771">Sir A. Markham</persName> &amp; Lord <persName xml:id="4024">Northcliffe</persName>. It is headed.</hi>
