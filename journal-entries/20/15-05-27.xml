<hi>I brought the lecture to a conclusion, but find myself more than ever disgusted with it. <persName xml:id="2806">Bayley</persName> lunched here, &amp; afterwards assisted me &amp; the Treasurer &amp; <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName> in transferring the treasures from my cellar to the strong room at the Lodge. They were shewing evidences of damp. Then Newby arrived to instruct us more accurately in the fire&#8211;extinguishing arrangements. We went through the series of water&#8211;points, &amp; strove to remember the instructions for their use, but, I fear, we should make a sad muddle of things if the pinch of a sudden trial came upon us. Meanwhile, to hearten us up a little, a fresh German raid is announced. Zeppelins have bombarded Southend, and killed two women &amp; a child! Hardly heroic warfare. After dinner I read the "Magna Carta" lecture to <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName>, who expressed approval &amp; interest, but this seemed more creditable to her generosity than to her faculty of judgment! I liked it less than before.</hi>
