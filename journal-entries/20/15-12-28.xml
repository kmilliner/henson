<hi>The children's service in the cathedral was a failure. To some small extent this was due to the weather, which was cheerless and wet. But mainly the root of the mischief was lack of preparation, &amp; for this I must blame primarily the <persName xml:id="2953">Sacrist</persName>, who has taken no sufficient pains in the matter, but secondarily, myself, for leaving him without stimulus. I wrote a little address, for like Augustus I write out every speech. After the service Colonel <persName xml:id="3512">Darwin</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3813">his wife</persName> with two of their sons came in to tea. The elder has been wounded at the front, &amp; is now recovering. He struck me as rather an ill&#8211;mannered young man: but, perhaps, this impression would not survive a closer acquaintance. I think, however, that we are somewhat too optimistic about the effect of their experiences upon the men at the Front. The daily routine of the trenches will hardly assist the higher life, and occasional episodes of heroism will scarcely avail as a counteracting influence to the normal tendencies &amp; habitudes. </hi>
