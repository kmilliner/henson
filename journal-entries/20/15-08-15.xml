<hi>I celebrated in the Cathedral at 8 a.m. Among the communicants I noticed </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="2950">Turner</persName></hi><hi> of Magdalen, who is staying with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName></hi><hi>. He is quite white though I should suppose that he can hardly be more than 2 years older than myself. The post brought an invitation to attend the autumnal meeting of the Congregational Union at Leeds in the beginning of October: but I returned a refusal on the score of other engagements in the South of England. I preached to the troops at 10 a.m., taking as my text the same verse as had served me last Sunday, "</hi><hi rend="underline">The earth is the Lord's, &amp; the fullness thereof</hi><hi>": but the sermon was different. The men seemed to me to be attentive: but I was assured afterwards by my guests that </hi><hi rend="underline">they</hi><hi> in the South Transept were with difficulty able to hear me on account of the echo! It is the case that I turned towards the North Transept, which was filled with soldiers, more than has been my wont. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Cruickshank</hi><hi> preached at2 Mattins on the Parable of the Pharisee &amp; the Publican, &amp; took occasion to warn us against an undue depreciation of the Germans! The admonition is needed, but I wish the Germans would not facilitate our transgression! The heaviness of the atmosphere is almost over&#8211;powering. </hi><persName xml:id="1696"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Olive</hi></persName><hi> coming to my study to fetch the library keys, caught me out in undignified slumber! After Evensong I walked vigorously with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Walter</hi><hi> for an hour in the effort to shake off this demoralizing stupor. On my return I found </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3553">Mead Falkner</persName></hi><hi> in the drawing&#8211;room, &amp; had a long talk with him. He thinks the War will last another two years.</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3553">Mead Falconer</persName></hi><hi> &amp; I tarried in the Cathedral, &amp; meditated on its majesty. It is '</hi><hi rend="underline">the embodiment of the sinister splendour of the North</hi><hi>', he said: &amp; I rejoined, "</hi><hi rend="underline">It is the Dies Irae in stone</hi><hi>". The most distinctive &amp; suggestive memorials of the Middle Ages are </hi><hi rend="underline">Durham Cathedral</hi><hi> &amp; the </hi><hi rend="underline">Dies Irae</hi><hi>. We lamented the decline of the Church of England, though our points of view are very different.</hi>
