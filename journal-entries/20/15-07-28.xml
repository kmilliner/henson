<hi>We started at noon, &amp; motored (in the <persName xml:id="276">Bishop's</persName> car) to Hartlepool. There we lunched with the <persName xml:id="3698">Macdonalds</persName> &amp; then, accompanied by Macdonald himself &amp; his son Fred, our new King's Scholar, we went to the Henry Smith School, &amp; were shown over the building by M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="4054" display="no">Alderson</persName> the Headmaster, before moving to the Town Hall for the Prize&#8211;giving. I performed this function, and made a speech to a numerous company of the town's folk. Then we motored to Billingham, being delayed on the road by a puncture, &amp; visited the very interesting parish church, of which the tower is said to be pre&#8211;Norman. Then we went to Norton, where <persName xml:id="3800">Canon Scott</persName> shewed us the fine parish church, a building of charm and interest. The recumbent statue of some unknown warrior with crossed legs &amp; feet resting on a lion &amp; a dragon rampant, especially struck me. From Norton we returned home through Sedgefield and Coxhoe, arriving a few minutes before 8 p.m. Then a few letters &amp; a little reading made an end of another day.</hi>
