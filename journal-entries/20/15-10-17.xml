<hi>A raw morning. I celebrated at 8 a.m. in the Cathedral. The cadets from the school were the bulk of the congregation. At 10 a.m. I preached to the troops, of whom there appeared to be a considerable number assembled. We are across the frontier of the coughing season, but they were fairly still. I did not attend Mattins, but stayed in my study in order to prepare a sermon for Bishop Auckland tonight. I attended Evensong in the cathedral, and afterwards motored to South Church, Bishop Auckland, and there preach [sic] to a very large congregation. <persName xml:id="648">Car&#x00F6;e</persName> accompanied me; we were both pleased with the heartiness of the singing, &amp; the closeness of the attention. We arrived back at the Deanery just as the Curfew was ringing at 9 p.m. While we sate at supper <persName xml:id="3553">Mead Falkner</persName> arrived, &amp; stayed talking until 11 p.m. I wrote to <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName>.</hi>
