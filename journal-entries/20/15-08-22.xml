<hi rend="italic">Scottish Sabbatarianism still survives as a power of secular inconvenience, though long since dead as a spiritual factor. I was unable to get a cab to transport me and my bag to the Cathedral. So I walked, picking up on the way a boy who carried my bag. He was Irish, &amp; informed that the Cathedral was 'once a Catholick church', a proposition I thought it uncandid to deny, &amp; futile to discuss. There was a large, and very attentive congregation. During the afternoon I rested in the Hotel, and then went again to the Cathedral for the evening service. There was a very large concourse of people, many being unable to gain admission to the service. However, I was assured that I was audible to everybody: &amp; certainly I could not desire a more attentive congregation. I read through most of the proofs of the volume of essays, which </hi><persName xml:id="3566"><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Foakes&#8211;Jackson</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> is editing. Most of them are quite remarkably good. My own <ref xml:id="850">contribution</ref> is incomparably the worst of the whole lot: but this is only partly my fault. To be set to handle an acutely controversial subject, and tied to the condition that the handling shall be uncontroversial, is to be imprisoned in a paradox, and doomed to futility &amp; dullness!</hi>
