<hi>A beautiful day&#8211;breaking, great bars of rosy light lying against the clear cold blue of a frosty sky, and on the ground everything fringed with the hoar&#8211;frost. Only about 200 soldiers came to the Church Parade at 10 a.m. The <persName xml:id="2785">Bishop of Jarrow</persName> preached to them, and, I think, gained their attention. They are still very shy of the hymns. There was a markedly small congregation at Mattins, when I preached! </hi><hi rend="underline">General <persName xml:id="3223">Gaisford</persName></hi><hi> came over from Newcastle &amp; spent the day here. The weather became very unfavourable as the evening drew on, so that he was easily persuaded to stay for the night.</hi><hi rend="italic"> <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I went to supper with <persName xml:id="3685">Professor</persName> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">rs</hi><hi rend="italic"> <persName xml:id="3686">Howe</persName> [How], in order to meet the <persName xml:id="2533">Bishop of Bristol</persName>. His Lordship is beginning to have the inevitable difficulties with the Ritualists, who appear to have seized the opportunity of the vacancy in the see in order to introduce the liturgical use of incense. It is truly a painful reflection that in this desperate time there should be Christian men, yea men who are charged with the ministerial office, whose real concern is with these trivialities. </hi><hi><persName xml:id="2809">Freeman</persName> came to inquire whether the bell&#8211;ringers were to come to supper on Tuesday. I bade him assure the men that they were expected, adding thus 8 more guests to my list.</hi>
