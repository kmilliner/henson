<hi>A chilly wet day, during which, save for Evensong in the Cathedral, I never left my study. But I was more or less 'on the sick list' with a chill. In the course of the morning I received a visit from M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="3664">Hooper</persName>, whom we have appointed to Bossall. He is elderly &amp; bearded with a gentle priestly manner, &amp; fanatical eyes. In answer to a question from me, he said that he had worne 'the vestments' for many years! Yet <persName xml:id="590">Watkins</persName> certainly gave the Chapter to understand that he did </hi><hi rend="underline">not</hi><hi>! Bishop <persName xml:id="2533">Nickson</persName> told me that the same duplicity had been practiced in the case of <persName xml:id="4019">Loxley</persName>. I received a very interesting letter from M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="4015" display="no">Dann</persName>, apparently one of the <orgName xml:id="276">Bede College</orgName> Students, now at the front. He has been through the recent fighting about Ypres.</hi>
