<hi>I presided at a Chapter Meeting for nearly two hours. We appointed <persName xml:id="648">Car&#x00F6;e</persName> architect with a retaining fee of fifty guineas, and approved the scheme for connecting the choristers with the Grammar School. <persName xml:id="590">Watkins</persName> raised a discussion on the allocation of duties, disclosing something like a revolt against the Dean! However, I returned a 'soft answer'. I attended Evensong. The <persName xml:id="276">Bishop of Durham</persName> admitted a number of men to be 'lay&#8211;readers' in the diocese. Then Bishop <persName xml:id="4044">Neligan</persName> preached for 40 minutes extemporaneously. He rambled from one point to another, collecting from the 'general store' of his memory fragments of many sermons, &amp; a whole succession of favourite perorations, working himself into that state of homiletic </hi><hi rend="underline">perspiration</hi><hi> which too often &amp; too easily is mistaken for </hi><hi rend="underline">inspiration</hi><hi>! The service was protracted so long that, when we got to the University cricket ground to see the military sports, everything had ended. I finished the sermon for tomorrow, &amp; wrote a Birthday letter to <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName>.</hi>
