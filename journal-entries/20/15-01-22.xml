<hi>The snow, which was falling briskly when we returned from Newcastle last night, had all disappeared before day&#8211;break, and the temperature was quite mild. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="3816">Bilson</persName>, the Architect, came to lunch. I tried to draw from him an opinion on the state of the vaulting, but he was very reticent. However I inferred that he mainly holds with <persName xml:id="3628">Greenwell</persName> that there is no cause for alarm. Then I took <persName xml:id="556">Jim</persName> to see the School; and arranged that <persName xml:id="2692">Budworth</persName> should celebrate next Sunday, &amp; that the King's Scholars should attend the Choral Celebration next Wednesday. Geordie <persName xml:id="571">Gore</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="275">Maimie Parker Smith</persName> arrived about tea&#8211;time.</hi>
