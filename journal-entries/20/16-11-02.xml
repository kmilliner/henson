<hi>There was but a small muster of Fellows in college. The sermon was preached by <persName xml:id="3708">Cholmondeley</persName>, who is now quite white. He referred, simply but sufficiently, to <persName xml:id="771">Mowbray</persName> and <persName xml:id="205">Cunliffe</persName>. After the service I walked with <persName xml:id="355">Fletcher</persName>; &amp; took his opinion on the matter of my undertaking the "Life'. He agreed with <persName xml:id="66">Frank</persName>. After lunching with the <persName xml:id="66">Pembers</persName><persName xml:id="937"></persName>, </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I walked with <persName xml:id="2718">Cruttwell</persName> to visit <persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName></hi><hi>, who has returned to the Acland Home, &amp; is evidently much better in health since his sojourn at Bournemouth. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">I had much talk with Cruttwell.</hi> <hi rend="italic">He says that his experiences at the Front have changed his modes of thinking in many respects. He told me that the soldiers generally resent the <persName xml:id="166">Bishop of London's</persName> manner of speaking about them: &amp; that his Lordship is really by no means popular in the Army. He speaks strongly about the </hi><hi rend="bold">[260] </hi><hi>[symbol] </hi><hi rend="italic">incompetence of many of the chaplains, the cowardice of some, and the self&#8211;indulgence of a few. This is sad hearing. The chaplain with whom he was brought into direct contact was an egregious jackass and so rigid a "Catholick" that he made a point of "not knowing" the Wesleyan padre, &amp; when, in his own absence, the latter officiated at the burial of some "Church of England" soldiers, he made a formal complaint to the authorities!</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="40">Graham Harrison</persName> carried me off to Evensong at Magdalen, &amp; this was refreshing. The anthem "Justorum animae in manu Dei sunt" [The souls of the just are in the hand of God] was beautifully sung. </hi><hi rend="italic">I dined in college, and sate beside <persName xml:id="2407">Johnson</persName>, with whom I was particularly anxious to discuss the "Life". He was emphatic in urging me to undertake it. In common room I got speech on the same subject with <persName xml:id="22">Ker</persName>. Thus I have gathered the opinions of the following viz: Pember, <persName xml:id="2141">Oman</persName>, Ker, Fletcher, Johnson, Graham Harrison, Cruttwell. And the opinion of <persName xml:id="3797">Dunbar&#8211;Buller</persName>, and the request of <persName xml:id="302">Miss Anson</persName>. It would seem hardly possible for me to decline the task. I had some talk with <persName xml:id="1427">Baker&#8211;Wilbraham</persName>, who has a very demure &amp; chastened aspect, which I put down to the "National Mission"! </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">I bought the little book which <persName xml:id="49">Gore</persName> has just published, and which is already selling by thousands. It is called <ref xml:id="828">"The Religion of the Church; a Manual of Membership"</ref>, and is marked by Gore's virtues &amp; by his defects.</hi> <hi rend="italic">It is sharply, but deservedly criticised by <persName xml:id="427">Ralph</persName> in a signed article, which appears in this week's issue of the "Guardian". I do not doubt that it will have a considerable influence &amp; not a wholesome one.</hi>
