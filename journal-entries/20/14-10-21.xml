<hi>There are no news of value from the seat of war. These great armies appear to have manoeuvred &amp; entrenched themselves into a position not unlike that known to chess players as stale&#8211;mate. They are not strong enough to move out of their present situations, from which however they are too strong to be evicted. It is stated that our weekly expenditure has now risen to over &#x00A3;8,000,000. The financial factor will perhaps decide an issue which the armies are unable to determine. I went into the Library with <persName xml:id="2791">Browne</persName> [Brown], &amp; caused the tables there to be re&#8211;arranged. Also, I attended Evensong in the Cathedral. After service I walked with <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>: and then settled myself to the task of composing a sermon about the war for next Sunday at Sunderland. </hi>
