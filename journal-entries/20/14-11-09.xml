<hi>We left <placeName xml:id="53">Wynyard</placeName> at 10.45 a.m., and reached Durham only just in time for me to go to the Town Hall in order to attend the ceremonies with which a new Mayor is elected &amp; inaugurated. These were followed by a procession to the Masonic Hall, at which light refreshments were served, and many speeches were made. I responded to the toast of the Bishop &amp; Clergy of All Denominations (!), &amp; was followed by a Papist &amp; a Sectary!! Then <persName xml:id="1898">Cruikshank</persName> took me off to the new School&#8211;house to consider divers small alterations, which <persName xml:id="3682">Wilkinson</persName> desired.</hi>
