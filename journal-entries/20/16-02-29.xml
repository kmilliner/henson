<hi>The battle of Verdun rages with ever&#8211;increasing fury. Though the Germans have forced the French back for some miles, it is still thought probable that their great attack will fail. In any event their losses will be colossal. To a mere on&#8211;looker it seems puzzling that they should be again allowed to attack without distraction elsewhere. </hi>

<hi>I met <persName xml:id="2920">Gee</persName> this afternoon: &amp; his first words were about the new appointment to the Deanery of Bristol, confessing thus the direction of his thoughts. It must certainly be mentally &amp; morally unwholesome (though, perhaps, it need not be actually sinful) to let one's thoughts run thus on 'preferment'. Probably, however, in a non&#8211;established church this kind of distraction is an even more formidable factor, for there much turns on the effort &amp; skill with which a minster succeeds in forcing himself into popular regard!</hi>
