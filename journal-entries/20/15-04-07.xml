<hi>A beautiful morning. I wrote a letter to Capt. <persName xml:id="747">Butler</persName> on the subject of </hi><hi rend="underline">Prayers for the Dead</hi><hi>. He wanted to know what was the doctrine of the Church of England: &amp; I sent him an extract from the charge of the late Archbishop <persName xml:id="171">Temple</persName>. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> <persName xml:id="4011">Joblin</persName></hi><hi>, the University's legal advisor, came to discuss with me the University's case against the <orgName xml:id="156" display="no">Ecclesiastical Commission</orgName>. It seems to me that there is even less force in it than I had supposed. After I had read carefully through the opinions of counsel, this impression was even strengthened.<note xml:id="277" n="1"></note> I took </hi><persName xml:id="403"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Dicey</hi></persName><hi> for a walk: he cannot go very far, &amp; was eager to sit down whenever the chance offered. Then I went to Evensong. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="2161">Ruth Spooner</persName></hi><hi> arrived for a short visit.</hi>
