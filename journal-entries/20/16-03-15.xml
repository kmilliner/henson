<hi>I received the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. <persName xml:id="3262">Lillingston</persName> celebrated. There were 8 communicants besides the clergy. The morning post brought me three post&#8211;cards numbered as parts of a single communication, an insulting anonymous one suggested apparently by <ref xml:id="871">my letter</ref> to the "Spectator". I recognize the hand&#8211;writing as having appeared on previous messages of insult. This one is signed "An officer", and probably comes from some Ritualistic 2</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi><hi> Lieutenant, perhaps one of the pious correspondents whose efforts appear weekly in the 'Church Times'. After lunch I walked &amp; talked with <persName xml:id="2841">Ernest</persName>: then attended Evensong, &amp; wrote letters. There are persistent rumours of a navel action in the North Sea.</hi>
