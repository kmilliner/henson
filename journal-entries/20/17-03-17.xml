I presided at a Chapter Meeting, and later proceeded to Leeds. My journey was relieved by the company &amp; conversation of a young naval officer, (Lieut. <persName xml:id="3568">Robert T. Bower</persName>. H.M.S. Lucia). He told me that he had been on board <persName xml:id="4100">Admiral Beatty's</persName> cruiser in the Battle of Jutland. <hi rend="bold underline">The feature of the battle which seemed to have impressed him most was the quantity of dead fish floating on the surface of the sea. These had been killed by the shock of the frequent explosions</hi>. On arriving at Leeds I had some difficulty in getting a taxi, but finally succeeded, &amp; was driven to Adel, a parish adjoining the city, where I was welcomed by M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> <persName xml:id="3587">Draper</persName>, the Vicar. The household work was being done by his two daughters, as a piece of war&#8211;work. I admired the simplicity of the arrangement, &amp; applauded the motive. Mine host sate talking indefatigably until past midnight, &amp; I had to make the first move to bed!
