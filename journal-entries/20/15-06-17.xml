<hi>We took <persName xml:id="648">Car&#x00F6;e</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1951">his wife</persName> with us, and motored to Raby, where we lunched with <persName xml:id="1559">Lord Barnard</persName>. After lunch he shewed us the <placeName xml:id="65">castle</placeName>, which is of great extent, extraordinary massiveness, &amp; remarkable beauty. As a specimen of feudal architecture, I hardly recall anything superior. This applies to the exterior. The interior has been handled very drastically &amp; for the most part with little taste. It is sufficiently evident that Lord Barnard appreciates his noble house, &amp; desires to maintain it worthily. Two appendages of feudalism &#8211; a herd of red deer, &amp; a heronry &#8211; yet survive on the Raby property. Later, I motored to Newcastle, and attended a meeting at the Town Hall in aid of the Children's Country Holiday Fund. I made a speech of about 20 minutes.</hi>
