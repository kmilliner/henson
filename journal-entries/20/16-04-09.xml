<hi>A glorious sun, with the air mild, &amp; all things calm &amp; beautiful. But the day worsened in character as the hours passed, &amp; by no means fulfilled its earlier promise. <persName xml:id="473">Knowling</persName> preached an excellent sermon on our Lord's challenge to the Jews, "Which of you convicted me of my sin?" which formed part of the gospel for the day. I celebrated the Holy Communion after Mattins. Miss Fogg Elliot came to lunch. I preached at Evensong to a scanty assemblage. The experience is salutary, if humiliating. It points the same moral as the failure to sell any book which bears my name. Such following as I have &#8211; on any showing a small one &#8211; is mainly outside the Church&#8211;going folks. In this little world of Durham, there are Evangelicals who distrust, and High Churchmen who dislike, a "liberal" clergyman, but there are some who welcome and support him. I am sure that, if one of the Minor Canons had been the Sunday afternoon preacher the congregations would certainly have been no smaller &amp; might have been much larger! <persName xml:id="1178" display="no">Clarence</persName> &amp; I walked through Houghall Wood after tea. In the level evening sun the Cathedral looked superb. After dinner we sate round the fire in the drawing [room] talking by the fire&#8211;light.</hi>

<hi>"I have done feasting, &amp; leave this place tomorrow. This luxury is not only opprobrious to us, but hurtful to the place, as only making a number of idle beggars. By that I spend, I reckon there is spent yearly by the Chapter at least &#x00A3;1000 a year in this unedifying way: a sum sufficient to erect and endow an Hospital for the sick. I have proposed to employ it that way. I don't meet with one who singly says yes: &amp; yet I don't believe I could get one to second me in Chapter. However I shall try at the next General Chapter."</hi>
