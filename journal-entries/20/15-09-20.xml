<hi>Most merciful God, Reader of all hearts, Judge of all Lives, have compassion on me, the weakest and worst of Thy servants. Thou knowest the full measure of my sin, and from Thee no circumstance of my life is hidden. Thy hand has been heavy upon me from my childhood. Again and again Thy Voice has called me, and I have striven not to hear. Thou hast placed me where I can neither be silent nor be unheard. Suffer not, O God, Thy Purpose in me to be frustrated by my sin, but incline my heart to Thy Will, and fashion my life after Thy commandments. Shew Thou me the way that I should walk in for I lift up my soul unto Thee, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.</hi>

<hi>I left Uppingham shortly after 10 a.m., and did not reach Durham until a few minutes before 7 p.m. There were long waits at Doncaster and York.</hi>
