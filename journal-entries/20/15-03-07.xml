<hi>A bright cold morning. I celebrated the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. <persName xml:id="3818">Hugh</persName> was among the communicants. I said to him afterwards, 'If we should never meet again, this parting were well made'. I addressed the soldiers at the military service. </hi><hi rend="italic">At Mattins <persName xml:id="3262">Lillingston</persName> preached the first of a course of four sermons on the Death of Christ. "A great subject for that equipment," was my comment to <persName xml:id="473">Knowling</persName> as we left the Cathedral, &amp; he rejoined, "Yes, indeed: I would not attempt it: would you?" To which I answered, "No: I could not." But L. is severely conventional, very ignorant, &amp; immensely self&#8211;complaisant. He has a good presence, a fine voice, &amp; some facility of speech. These appear to be the essentials of great success as an Evangelical orator. <persName xml:id="2806">Bayley</persName> came to lunch, &amp; talked on historical subjects with <persName xml:id="250">Watson</persName>. The latter preached at Evensong &#8211; an interesting discourse, &amp; on the whole well&#8211;heard. I went to S. Cuthbert's, &amp; there preached. In my sermon I made careful reference to Charles <persName xml:id="3693">Caldcleugh</persName>, the late Mayor, who had been a member of that congregation. There was a good congregation among which I noticed several members of the Town Council. Hugh Lyon returned to his military duties at Gateshead after supper. Watson &amp; I talked awhile together before turning in.</hi>
