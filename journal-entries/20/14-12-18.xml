<hi>This morning's paper raises the death&#8211;rate at the Hartlepools to 86. In the course of the day it was announced that fresh attacks were anticipated, and that the population had been ordered to evacuate the town. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">The "Times" announces that Egypt has been declared a British Protectorate</hi><hi>.<note xml:id="262" n="1"></note> It would appear that the senseless <persName xml:id="3678">Khedive</persName>, having thrown in his lot with Germany &amp; Turkey, has been promptly 'eliminated'. I attended Evensong in the cathedral, &amp; wrote a number of letters. Also I finished reading a curiously interesting book, <persName xml:id="2732" display="no">Disraeli's</persName> <ref xml:id="776">"Lord George Bentinck"</ref>. The new volume of Disraeli's <ref xml:id="808">'Life'</ref> induced a curiosity which, as the volume was on my shelves, I was able to satisfy. The chapter on the Jews is priceless.</hi>
