<hi>We started reading Mattins in the Galilee, which I have ordered for the month of August in order to give the lay&#8211;vicars a rest. The service was at 9.30 a.m. &amp; took less than half an hour. I wrote letters to <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> and to Alan <persName xml:id="3885">Radford</persName>. At Evensong the Cathedral was filled with people, mainly holiday&#8211;makers seeking cover from the rain. However, they behaved quite properly during the service. The papers are filled with various pronouncements on the completion of a year of war. Among these, the German Emperor's is conspicuous for its brazen insolence of falsehood. He takes God to witness that he never willed the war, that Germany was wantonly attacked, and so forth. Of course it is all for home consumption.</hi>
