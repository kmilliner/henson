<hi>I chose (in my bath!) the text on which to preach to the troops at Darlington. </hi><hi rend="underline">"The earth is the Lord's &amp; the fullness thereof: the world &amp; they that dwell therein".</hi><hi> The substance of the sermon had been prepared yesterday. Colonel <persName xml:id="3991">Grimshaw</persName> &amp; his brother fetched me in a motor, &amp; drove me to the camp which was pleasantly situated in a Park beyond Darlington. The Church Parade went off well enough, &amp; everybody assured me that my address was heard. Many of the officers were leaving for the front, &amp; said goodbye to me with signs of emotion. Major <persName xml:id="4055">Carter</persName> V.C. &amp; his wife drove me back to Durham, &amp; stayed to lunch. After Evensong an officer named Priestly with his wife came to tea, &amp; went over the Deanery. Then I betook myself to writing letters.</hi>
