<hi>The weather has become stormy and wet. I spent the morning in writing letters, among them one to <persName xml:id="3309">Guest&#8211;Williams</persName>, who has lost his son in the recent fighting, and one to <persName xml:id="1255">Linetta</persName>, who is now settled in Florence for awhile. I got shaved in the village, for by some mischance my shaving tackle was left in London, &amp; then I called on the Rector, and offered to preach for him next Thursday, when the Harvest Thanksgiving is observed in his church. After lunch <persName xml:id="77">Marion</persName> and I walked on the cliffs, but the wind and rain soon sent us home again. I wrote letters to Alan <persName xml:id="3885">Radford</persName>, Charley <persName xml:id="2118" display="no">Cunninghame</persName>, and <persName xml:id="3513">Cummings</persName>. <persName xml:id="4066">Serres</persName>, the Rector, called, &amp; undertook to post them. </hi>
