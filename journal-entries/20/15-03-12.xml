<hi>I continued work on the Article, &amp; wrote a short sermon for next Sunday. Also I wrote a number of letters, none of them very important, &amp; corrected the proofs of the lecture on 'Kikuyu' for the <ref xml:id="775">'Modern Churchman'</ref>. Beyond these futilities I did no more than take Logic for a walk, &amp; read the papers.</hi>

<hi>There are four nests in building by the rooks in the tree next [^to^] M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Fowler's wall: and none at all in the trees in the back garden. I suspect that the presence of no less than three motor cars in the adjoining garages, not to say also the introduction of heating apparatus with a chimney almost underneath their old nesting ground, may have disgusted the birds with these trees.</hi>
