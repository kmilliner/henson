<hi>The country was covered with snow during the night, and fresh snow&#8211;falls more than made up for the wastage by thawing during the day. Before breakfast I wrote to </hi><hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="113">Harold Knowling</persName></hi><hi>, and started reading </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="359">Sanday</persName> &amp; Williams</hi><hi> on "</hi><hi rend="underline">Form and Content in the Christian Tradition</hi><hi>"<ref xml:id="843"></ref>. This very interesting and illuminating exchange of letters engaged my leisure during the day, and I finished it before dinner. I wrote a letter to the "Record", </hi><hi rend="bold underline">answering some editorial references to me in this week's issue</hi><hi>. I attended Mattins and Evensong. Also I celebrated the Holy Communion at midday. After Evensong I walked round Houghall Wood. Logic accompanied me as far as the wood, and then lost himself. However, he turned up again about 10 p.m.</hi>
