<hi>The weather which was doubtful enough at morning improved sufficiently as the day passed to permit <persName xml:id="2841">Ernest</persName> and me to make an expedition in the car. We went to Raby, and called at the <placeName xml:id="65">castle</placeName>, but, as <persName xml:id="1559">Lord Barnard</persName> was out, I left a card, and came away. Then we visited Staindrop Church, &amp; viewed the tombs of the Westmorelands and the Clevelands. The Church itself has unusual architectural interest. We then returned on our tracks, and, skirting Durham through Neville's Cross, went on to Finchale, where we viewed the ruins of the <placeName xml:id="64">Priory</placeName>, and had tea in the farm&#8211;house. We got back to the Deanery about 6.30 p.m. Here we found that the Bishops of <persName xml:id="276">Durham</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="667">Dover</persName> had already arrived. Three unmarried ladies of suitable age came to dinner, <persName xml:id="3519">Miss Headlam</persName>, <persName xml:id="3679">Miss Christopher</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="3487">Miss Cooper</persName>, and we passed the evening without friction. Ernest was a great acquisition, &amp;, by his quaint humourous descriptions of life on the Canadian prairie, amused &amp; informed us all. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">The more I see of him, &amp; talk with him, the better I like him, and, I think, the higher I rate his powers.

<hi>The "British Weekly" for July 2</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi><hi> 1908 contains an article on 'F. W. <persName xml:id="3776">Robertson</persName> of Brighton' by "Claudius Clear" (i.e. W. Robertson <persName xml:id="492">Nicoll</persName>)</hi>

<hi>"On two or three occasions I had the advantage of discussing the subject with his son, the late M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> C. B. <persName xml:id="3971">Robertson</persName>, of the Foreign Office. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> R. had the deepest veneration for his father's memory, &amp; was the jealous custodian of his reputation. He read &amp; collected every appreciation that appeared, &amp; it may be of interest to say that he thought one by D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> W. J. Dawson the best of all. He was inclined to agree that a new biography sh</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> be written, but he hesitated to interfere with D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Brooke's excellent work. …..</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>It is pretty well known that a very large number of R.'s letters are still unpublished. Many of them were addressed to the late Lady <persName xml:id="3977">Byron</persName>. These are in the hands of his trustees. There are many other manuscripts, which are, perhaps, more accessible. Also, for some reason or another D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Brooke exercised an extra&#8211;ordinary reserve. It will be seen on reference that we are not allowed to have the name of M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> R.'s correspondents, with very few exceptions. The time has, perhaps, come when these names should be published. I believe that every one of these correspondents is now dead, &amp; I understand that a great majority of the letters were addressed to ladies. …..</hi>

<hi>The "British Weekly" published some notes from "People who remember Frederick Robertson.":&#8211;</hi>
         </p>
         <p>C. A. J. writes:</p><div type="quote"><p>"When ministering in the service of his church, the robes worn greatly added to the dignity of his bearing, &amp; he had a most impressive &amp; reverent appearance. His reading, too, of the service was truly impressive &amp; devotional. I remember in this connection the great force &amp; power given to the Decalogue, with the result that it came as if direct from the lips of Moses the Law&#8211;giver…. His voice, never loud or noisy, was singularly clear and expressive, &amp; his manner, though in no way theatrical, could not fail to impress."
         </p></div>
         <p>
J. G. at the age of 15 had met R. at Wiesbaden in 1847, &amp; was immensely impressed by his preaching in the hotel.</p><div type="quote"><p> "At that time M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> R. was leaving, or had just left, Cheltenham, &amp; said he felt quite unsuited for cultured people such as were in a place like that: he could not kow&#8211;tow to them, &amp; a rough village congregation, not easily hurt by plain speaking, was more to his taste. Instead of that he went to Brighton, &amp; there made his mark."

         <p>
<hi>'The Dean assigns M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Robertson a very high place among preachers. "It is not too much," he remarks, "to say that he has become, beyond question, the greatest preacher of the 19</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> century, the most widely admired, &amp; with the most powerful reasons for this widespread judgment." He refers to the circumstance, that his are the only sermons that have been published in the Tauchnitz's edition, "side by side with the novels of Dickens or the essays of Macaulay." …… "Other preachers, other teachers, have arisen since, but there is no one who so filled the place allotted to him as Frederick Robertson did at the time, &amp; there is no one who so holds that place now that he has departed from us."[']</hi>
