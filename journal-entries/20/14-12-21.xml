<hi>A freezing fog. I took <persName xml:id="3230">Streeter</persName> into the Cathedral after breakfast, &amp; shewed him the cracks in the vaulting. Then he went off by the 10.29 a.m. express. I motored to Cocken, &amp; fetched back General <persName xml:id="3223">Gaisford</persName>, whom <persName xml:id="3513">Cummings</persName> had taken out earlier. The fog was thick, &amp; driving dangerous; but we had no accident. I found Col: <persName xml:id="1659">Burdon</persName> at Cocken; he says that the men at Hartlepool claim to have sunk one of the German ships: &amp; that the German gunnery was very bad. I attended Evensong in the Cathedral.</hi>
