I arrived in the <persName xml:id="228">Warden's</persName> Lodgings at All Souls, shortly before 5 p.m. My journey was relieved by the company of a young officer, 2</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi><hi> Lieut: Norman Piper, who came from Sunderland, &amp; had been in the congregation at Christ Church last Sunday morning. I had some conversation with <persName xml:id="66">Frank</persName> about the late Warden's 'Life...' <persName xml:id="40">Graham Harrison</persName> came to dinner, and a junior Fellow named <persName xml:id="3742">Rawson</persName>, who is now employed in munitions manufacture at Middlesborough.
