<hi>I received the Holy Communion in the <placeName xml:id="77">Gregory Chapel</placeName>. The <persName xml:id="2800">Precentor</persName> celebrated. There were, perhaps, as many as a dozen communicants. I attended the special service at 6.30 p.m., &amp; heard <persName xml:id="3496">Dennett</persName> preach a very poor little thoughtless sermon on Caiaphas. I was disappointed by his performance, as I was told that he enjoyed some reputation as a preacher. I paid <persName xml:id="3514">Laidler's</persName> account for petrol, &amp; divers other accounts. Also, I drew out &#x00A3;25 from the Bank against my travelling expenses tomorrow. I received no letters of interest, and wrote none.</hi>
