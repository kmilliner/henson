Then I attended Mattins, and listened to a sermon from </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3262">Lillingston</persName></hi><hi> about the War. He assumes as if it were self&#8211;evident that God is punishing England for its irreligion by bringing upon it this dreadful visitation: &amp; he suggests that reformation is the only road to victory. As an example of the wickedness for which the nation is being visited, he mentioned that he himself had recently visited a camp of 5000 soldiers &amp; celebrated the Holy Communion at 7 a.m., and that only 3 communicants presented themselves! After Mattins, I celebrated the Holy Communion, &amp; then walked with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="2685">Charnwood</persName></hi><hi> before lunch.</hi>
