<hi>A dull treacherous day with intermittent down&#8211;pourings &amp; a suggestion of unseasonable thunder. I preached in the Cathedral at Mattins, &amp; afterwards celebrated. There was an unusually small congregation. In the afternoon I attended Evensong in the Cathedral. No less than 11 clergy, all members of the Foundation, were in the Procession viz: Dean, 4 canons major, 1 hon. canon, 3 canons minor, and 2 schoolmasters. An old British cruiser has been sunk in the straits of Dover by a German submarine; most of the crew is reported to have been saved.</hi>

<hi>A young American artist, now resident in Durham, came to tea. He said he had received a letter from America indicating that public opinion in that country is strongly on the side of the Allies.</hi>
