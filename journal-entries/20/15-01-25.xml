<hi>A British Naval victory in the North Sea yesterday. The Germans were evidently out for another Hartlepool raid, but this time they were caught &amp; got back to port with the loss of a large cruiser, &amp; the damage of two other vessels. I attended Mattins, &amp; then picked up M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Hardy in the Cathedral &amp; took him to the 'Treasury', in order that he might point out to me the condition of our muniments. That condition is, indeed, discreditable. We motored to Brancepeth to attend the funeral of M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="3988">Shafto</persName>. There was a large gathering of friends &amp; neighbours. We got back just in time for Evensong in the Cathedral. After service I arrange [sic] with <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName> about the seating of the procession next Wednesday. Geordie <persName xml:id="571">Gore</persName> left for Scotland after lunch.</hi>
