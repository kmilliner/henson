<hi>We essayed to visit the Hartlepools, &amp; there to see the evidences of German warfare, but our motor was stopped by soldiers &amp; police, &amp; we were not suffered to proceed, since we could not honestly plead that our business was either important or urgent. While we were having tea, General <persName xml:id="3223">Gaisford</persName> (whom we met last year at Linburn) made his appearance: he is visiting Durham on a tour of official inspection. Soon after <persName xml:id="3230">Streeter</persName> appeared. We added the General to our dinner party, which was completed by <persName xml:id="3161">Dawson Walker</persName>. </hi>
