<hi rend="bold underline">I received some letters with reference to my "Times" <ref xml:id="874">letter</ref>.

It is a fact which challenges explanation. Partly I suspect it arises from the isolating effect of an arbitrary discipline or habit of life. The total abstainer (like the Papist) lies outside the main stream of the national life, &amp; his points of view are not the same as those of his neighbours. Then he lives in an atmosphere of eager proselytisim</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi><hi> the most morally perverting conceivable. Everything is seen in connexion with the dominating interest. Total abstinence becomes the shibboleth of a sect, &amp; the standard of all moral reckoning. Hence the familiar tokens of sectarianism exhibit themselves in the Total Abstainer &#8211; rancourous bitterness against opponents, a lop&#8211;sided view of life, &amp; an enormous vanity. "</hi><hi rend="underline">We are they that ought to speak, who is Lord over us?</hi><hi>" &#8211; that is the attitude of the Total Abstainer to the world. And all the while he is in a small minority. He represents the tyranny of the few over the many.</hi>
