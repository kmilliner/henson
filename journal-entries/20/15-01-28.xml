<hi>I had barely time to shew the Cuthbert relics to Sir John <persName xml:id="2069">Barran</persName> after breakfast before he and <persName xml:id="3178">Hadow</persName> had to go to the station. I attended Mattins in the Cathedral, &amp; then walked with <persName xml:id="427">Ralph</persName> through Houghall Wood. After lunch I called on <persName xml:id="3137">John Wilson</persName>, but failed to see him as he was asleep, &amp; I would not have him waked. Then I attended Evensong, &amp; afterwards talked with Ralph. After an early dinner I attended the annual meeting of the <orgName xml:id="239">Y.M.C.A.</orgName> The society is miserably housed, but it is doing very good work in entertaining the soldiers, who would otherwise have no shelter but the public&#8211;house. I cannot conceal from myself that the members are a feeble folk to look at, &amp; not very inviting. However, they evidently take themselves seriously, and are bustling forward as usefully as they can: &amp; what can be wanted more?</hi>
