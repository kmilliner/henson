<hi>Reeve forgot to order the cab for the <persName xml:id="574">Burkitts</persName><persName xml:id="573"></persName> with the result that they had to postpone their departure until after lunch. I spent the morning with <persName xml:id="206">Baddeley</persName> in the Cathedral; and acted the showman again. <persName xml:id="3981">Gilbert Darwin</persName> came to lunch, and afterwards walked round Houghall with me. Baddeley &amp; <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> also came. Gilbert is a frank, intelligent lad, ambitious of becoming an airman when he leaves Winchester. <persName xml:id="2658">Kathleen</persName> arrived during our absence, &amp; received us with enthusiasm. I attended Evensong. Baddeley had an early dinner by himself, and went off to Edinburgh afterwards.</hi>
