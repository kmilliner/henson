<hi>I received an interesting letter from <persName xml:id="3818">Hugh Lyon</persName>: wrote several letters: paid <persName xml:id="3513">Cummings</persName> his wages: completed my preparations for travelling: &amp; went off to London with <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName>.</hi>

<hi>We stayed at the Deanery, Westminster, for the weekend. The <persName xml:id="325">Dean</persName> was more or less confined to his bed all that time, but was carried down in a basket chair for dinner. The <persName xml:id="427">Inges</persName><persName xml:id="1209"></persName> dined, and M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="4029">Boyd</persName> a son of the well&#8211;known <persName xml:id="4030">Scottish minister</persName>. I went to the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName> after tea, &amp; there found Sir <persName xml:id="344">Henry Craik</persName>, who poured out his soul on the subject of the new Choir School in <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName>, which has evidently annoyed him much. The long delay caused by the strikes has protracted the nuisance!</hi>
