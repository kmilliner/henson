<hi>A glorious bright morning. The 3</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi><hi> casualty list brings the British losses to about 15,000 killed, wounded &amp; missing. Some of the latter will probably rejoin the Army after an interval.</hi>

<hi>I attended a meeting of the National Relief Committee at the Shire Hall: &amp; afterwards went on to the Assize Court, where the recruits were being sworn in. They appeared for the most part a fine well&#8211;built set of young men, nearly all miners.</hi>

<hi><persName xml:id="3695">Steinthal</persName> came to see me. He has enlisted, &amp; is now concerned for his wife, who will continue to live in Durham. Would the Dean &amp; Chapter, as Governing Body, make his wife an allowance? I said that the disposition of the D. &amp; C. would certainly be as favourable as the circumstances permitted: &amp; I asked what amount he considered w</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> be sufficient. He mentioned &#x00A3;100. I said that I w</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> consult my colleagues, &amp; let him know what we would do.</hi>
