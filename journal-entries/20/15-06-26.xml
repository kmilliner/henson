<hi>A steady rain, very welcome to the farmers. I spent most of the morning in writing letters. Then I went into the Church and conversed with <persName xml:id="2809">Freeman</persName>. He told me that one of the congregation observed with respect to the <persName xml:id="276">Bishop's</persName> sermon last Wednesday, that 'it was the first manly sermon he had ever heard him preach'! This probably indicates the fact that it was also the first sermon which had been fairly intelligible to the good man. The charm of all these 'war' sermons is mainly the fact that they are within the range of the common mind, &amp; accord pleasantly with the popular prejudice!</hi>
