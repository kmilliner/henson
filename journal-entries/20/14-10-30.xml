<hi>The meeting at Langley Moor was very well attended. I took out the Mayor &amp; Alderman <persName xml:id="3559">Thwaites</persName> in the car. <persName xml:id="3462">Lord Durham</persName> spoke well &amp; briefly. There were three Belgians on the platform, middle&#8211;aged men heavy to look at &amp; speaking Flemish. I spoke for about 15 minutes &amp; was well listened to, but I fear the effect of my words was destroyed by a portentous tub&#8211;thumper named Brass, who ranted &amp; roared at the youth disastrously. </hi>
