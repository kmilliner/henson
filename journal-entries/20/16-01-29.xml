He says that 'a fierce newspaper correspondence broke out in his time on the subject, when the Rev</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> A. D. Wagner, the son of the old Vicar, took up the cudgels very strongly for his father'. The Dean adds that he 'is steeped in Robertson lore of a sort', but he is unable to throw any light on the point which puzzles me viz: how did the amazing popularity of the posthumously&#8211;published sermons arise?</hi>
