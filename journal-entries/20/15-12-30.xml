<hi>I started a new sermon for next Sunday afternoon, but made little headway. <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName> invaded me with his income&#8211;tax paper in hand, vehemently aggrieved: but I advised him to acquiesce, &amp; told him fairly that he had in my judgment no grievance, and would perhaps do himself no good if he pressed another appeal on the Chapter. I walked with Logic, who again went 'on his own', and came back brazenly at his own time. Then I attended Evensong. After that there was nothing but desultory reading until bed &#8211; a poor record indeed! The weather is curiously unseasonable &#8211; high temperature, violent gales, and at intervals deluges of rain. This circumstance undoubtedly contributes no mean supports to the indigenous indolence of one's nature. And then there is always the War &#8211; an obsession, an evil dream, a resident terror, making all things futile, &amp; nothing reasonable! Such news as is allowed to filter through is doubtful &amp; almost contradictory, raising more questions than it answers. </hi>
