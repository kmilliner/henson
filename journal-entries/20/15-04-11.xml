<hi>A dull morning, damp &amp; overcast. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went with me to Cocken, where I addressed about 800 men of the <orgName xml:id="283">'Pals'</orgName> battalion. The service was held in a long low hut, of which the atmosphere became asphyxiating. We got back to the Cathedral just in time for mattins. <persName xml:id="473">Knowling</persName> preached an admirable sermon, girding fiercely at the critics of Germany, whom he evidently suspects of being the real villains of this tragical piece, which is now being enacted on the European stage! I celebrated the Holy Communion, attended Evensong, walked with Logic, talked with Col. <persName xml:id="3991">Grimshaw</persName> &amp; his wife &#8211; who leaves Durham tomorrow &#8211; &amp; then wrote letters. The <persName xml:id="2800">Precentor</persName> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="3448">Culley</persName> came in to dinner: and <persName xml:id="2161">Ruth</persName> discoursed very learnedly on music. <persName xml:id="3262">Lillingston</persName> came in to consult me about volunteering for service with the troops.</hi>
