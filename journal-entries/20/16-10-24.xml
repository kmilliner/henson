<hi>I wrote to <persName xml:id="66">Frank Pember</persName>, asking his counsel in the matter of the <persName xml:id="228">Warden's</persName> "Life", &amp; saying that it did not seem possible for me to undertake it unless I were commissioned by the general wish of the College. Also, I wrote to the <persName xml:id="2533">Bishop of Bristol</persName>, answering his letter (v.p.332). As I was entering the Cathedral for Mattins, <persName xml:id="1854">Bourchier</persName> laid hold of me. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">He had been functioning as "Archbishops' Messenger", &amp; was returning to town</hi><hi>. He had been at Ferryhill, &amp; seemed pleased with his experiences there. I took the book <ref xml:id="862">"Where Socialism Failed"</ref> to the Carpenter's shop, and lent it to <persName xml:id="3820">Jopling</persName>, who is said to be himself a Socialist. I told him to read it carefully, and then to tell me what he thought of it. </hi>

<hi><persName xml:id="3571">George Nimmins</persName> came in at noon, &amp; assisted me to re&#8211;arrange my books. I design an order of convenience by which the books most often in use are readiest to hand, but the inconvenient size of volumes &amp; capacities of shelves are formidable difficulties.</hi>
