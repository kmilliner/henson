<hi>The <orgName xml:id="126">Diocesan Conference</orgName> assembled in the Chapter House at 11.15 o'clock, and the <persName xml:id="276">Bishop</persName> opened the proceedings very punctually. I took my statutory position at the Bishop's right hand, and in due course read the paper I had prepared on the social consequences of the war. It was listened to with attention, and applauded at the close. I was immediately followed by <persName xml:id="3178">Hadow</persName> who spoke admirably on the economic consequences of the War. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">He was as optimistic as I was the reverse</hi><hi>. The discussion did not amount to much, and was mostly directed to Hadow's Paper. We both replied shortly, &amp; then went off for lunch. I did not return to the Conference, but attended Evensong, and then entertained the Bishop at tea. Then I took Logic for a constitutional, &amp; was somewhat fatigued as the weather became suddenly very warm. <persName xml:id="3842">Craster</persName> arrived about 6 p.m. He is now Junior Proctor, and returning to Oxford for the term. He is familiar enough with Durham, &amp; knows all the antiquaries here. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">I received a letter from <persName xml:id="600">Ernest Rudling</persName>, who now aspires to become a flying&#8211;man. He seeks my advice on the momentous question whether he may reasonably aspire to the hand of <persName xml:id="1812">Angel C.</persName></hi><hi rend="italic">! This love&#8211;making in khaki is a tiresome and risky business. I fear that most of these so&#8211;called "War&#8211;marriages" will not turn out well. Khaki </hi><hi rend="italic underline">seems</hi><hi rend="italic"> to obliterate all the normal differences and distinctions. Girls especially seem ready to assume that every officer must be also a gentleman: and marriages are hastily arranged, and carried through. Out of his transfiguring khaki the officer will become again what everybody save sentimental young women always knew him to be. There will then be some woeful disillusionment, &amp; some scandalous separations.</hi>
