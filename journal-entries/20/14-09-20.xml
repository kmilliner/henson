<hi><persName xml:id="3262">Lillingston</persName> read the lessons &amp; his declaration of assent, thus completing his preliminaries. I celebrated the Holy Communion after Mattins. A. L. <persName xml:id="1170">Smith</persName> was in church, &amp; sent me a pencilled note to say so, but he could not wait to see me. The Anthem in the Cathedral at Evensong was admirably sung. Immediately after service <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I motored to Stockton, where I preached to a large congregation in the parish Church &#8211; a hideous structure built in Queen Anne's reign, &amp; since improved &amp; embellished, said to seat 1500 people &#8211; I took for my text the grim words of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> <hi>Paul: 'Be not deceived: God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap'. After service, we had supper with <persName xml:id="3856">Canon Martin</persName> &amp; his family in the Rectory. We arrived at the Deanery shortly after 10 p.m.</hi>
