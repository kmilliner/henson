<hi>I finished with difficulty the Oxford sermon on 'War &amp; Religion': it is the merest sketch, &amp; tails off lamentably into the feeblest of conclusions. The place &amp; audience are disconcerting, for </hi><hi rend="underline">everything</hi><hi> that I say must needs be twisted into a polemical sense, &amp; then resented on that account. The Church feeling of Oxford is very hostile to me, though a certain kindness is felt for me personally. I attended Evensong in the Cathedral, &amp; afterwards attended the Mayor's meeting in the Town Hall Chamber. Here I 'bit off the head of' the ass, <persName xml:id="3854">Bothamly</persName>, with a frank contempt of prudence which would have been more fitting 30 years ago! We had a reception for Colonel <persName xml:id="3833">Blackett</persName> &amp; his officers. Sundry neighbours came in, &amp; we passed the time adequately.</hi>
