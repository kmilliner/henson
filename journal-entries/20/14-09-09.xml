<hi>Dull thunderous day with rain in the afternoon. I finished a short sermon for next Sunday afternoon, &amp; attended Evensong in the Cathedral. <persName xml:id="3854">Bothamley</persName> called on me, &amp; obtained two guineas for his <orgName xml:id="239">Y.M.C.A.</orgName> I grudge the money, which I cannot afford, &amp; which I suspect is not well bestowed. He began to talk about Evangelical interpretation of the Apocalypse, but I cut him short with the curt declaration that I knew nothing about the subject &amp; cared less! Be it noted that I had my hair cut by the Durham hair&#8211;dresser &#8211; a bold undertaking!</hi>
