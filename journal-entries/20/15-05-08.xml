<hi>A chill morning, sunless &amp; damp, infinitely depressing for travellers. The 'Lusitania' had nearly 2000 persons on board: and so far no more than 600 are reported as saved: but there were many boats available, the weather was fine, and the great ship took some little time to sink. The interesting question now rises, what will America do? If, as appears to be the case, many Americans were on board, there must needs be much indignation in the States. We made our final dispositions for departure, and then left for Bristol by the 10.29 express. Before leaving I wrote to the Editor of the "Churchman" refusing an article on "Kikuyu".</hi>
