<hi>A bright morning with high wind. I sent a telegram to the organizing secretary 'crying off' tonight's meeting, &amp; indicating uncertainly as to my turning up at Bishop Auckland tomorrow. </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName></hi><hi> took me for a walk. The view of the Cathedral after the rain was wonderful. There are no war&#8211;news today: the Germans are evidently making a great stand on the Aisne. The Allies will have a difficult business in dislodging them, nevertheless they seem to be addressing themselves to the task with great courage and determination. I read through the statement of Britain's case which has been issued by six of the Oxford Modern History Tutors. It is very impartially expressed, but leaves a very definite impression on the mind. The appendix of documents adds considerably to its value.</hi>
