<hi rend="italic">The weather has been almost all that can be wished today. I spent the morning in writing to the Press! </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">Inspired by <persName xml:id="3262">Lillingston's</persName> visit, I wrote a long letter &amp; headed it "Festina Lente" [make haste slowly]. This dealt with the proposal to substitute the Holy Communion for Mattins as "the principal service" on the Lord's Day. I sent this letter to the "Record" and the "Challenge". Also I wrote a short letter to the "Times" heading it "Bigotry in excelsis"</hi><hi rend="italic">, a title which I borrowed from the S. Columba's Ch. of Scotland Church Magazine. There it introduced an extract from the Scotsman stating that a vicar had been willing to lend his church on a Sunday for the Church Parade of a Scottish regiment stationed in the North of England, but that the Bishop had intervened to disallow the arrangement. This I quoted and called for some explanation.</hi>

<hi>I presided at a meeting of Chapter. We appointed M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="3929">Maclean</persName>, a curate of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Mark's, South Shields, to the benefices of Heighington and Bolam. After the Chapter, we held the half&#8211;yearly audit. I attended Evensong: as I came out of the Cathedral, I met <persName xml:id="2841">Ernest</persName> arriving from the station. After tea, we walked round Houghall, enjoying the beautiful evening.</hi>

<hi>A great naval action in the North Sea is reported in which the British losses are so severe that the Germans appear to have scored a substantial success. It is feared that the loss of life has been very great, as Admiral Jellicoe's despatches, while stating the number of ships lost, make no mention of survivors.<note xml:id="311" n="1"></note> The Zeppelins would appear to be of more value as </hi><hi rend="underline">scouts</hi><hi> than as </hi><hi rend="underline">raiders.</hi>
