<hi>After breakfast I walked to 63 Hallgarth Street to find out whether </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4065">Youd</persName></hi><hi> could drive me on Sunday. His wife assured me that he could. Then I went home &amp; finished the Stanhope sermon. Which done I went to the Bank &amp; changed a cheque for &#x00A3;30. I attended Evensong, and walked with Logic. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="2806">Bayley</persName></hi><hi> accompanied me. </hi><hi rend="italic">He told me a strange story of </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3553">Meade Faulkener's</persName></hi><hi rend="italic"> <persName xml:id="3792">father</persName>. His valuable library became on his death a subject of contention among his children, who, being unable to agree in dividing the books, agreed to destroy them. They were burned accordingly, one charred missal being rescued by M. F. That seems an incredible legend.</hi><hi> Before setting out for <placeName xml:id="62">Lumley</placeName> I wrote to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, &amp; also some 'business' letters. I arrived at Lumley about 10 minutes after 8 o'clock, &amp; was met at the door by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3465">Lord Scarbrough</persName></hi><hi>. Nobody else was at dinner save the Archbishop, <persName xml:id="3466">Lady S.</persName> &amp; myself. </hi>
