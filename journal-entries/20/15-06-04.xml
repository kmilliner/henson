<hi>A most glorious day, but almost too warm. The Fall of Pryemysl is reported, &amp; the Austro&#8211;German advance on Lemberg [sic]. Everywhere else nothing of consequence is reported. I worked at the sermon, &amp; finished it. <persName xml:id="3470">Sykes</persName>, <persName xml:id="4031">Roberson</persName>, <persName xml:id="3698">Macdonald</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="4028">Hopkinson</persName> came to lunch with two ladies. Old D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="3628">Greenwell</persName>, our famous antiquary, now 95 years old, came across in his chair, &amp; inspected the Deanery. He inquired of me with much appearance of concern whether it were indeed the case that the Acca Cross was to be returned to Hexham.<note xml:id="281" n="1"></note> "I would never have presented it to the Dean &amp; Chapter if I had thought that was possible". I told him that the silly rumours had no better foundation than a jest, the Rector of Hexham having expressed his desire for the Cross, and I having replied mockingly, 'Ah: wouldn't that be nice!' But how such things get repeated, I marvel.</hi>

<hi>Later, <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName> came in. He says that the Council had offered the headship of the <orgName xml:id="281">Women's Hostel</orgName> to Helen <persName xml:id="3697">Watkins</persName>!</hi>
