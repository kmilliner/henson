We went up to the triforium, &amp; mounted the scaffolding. Canon <persName xml:id="3470">Sykes</persName> lunched with me; and after our meal we attended a meeting of the Church Defence Committee. Then I attended Evensong in the Cathedral, cheered with the information that the redoubtable "Emden" had at last been destroyed. I dined quietly with <persName xml:id="2748">Wilson</persName>. The rest of the company was composed of Sir Hedworth <persName xml:id="3866">Williamson</persName> and Miss Wilson.</hi>
