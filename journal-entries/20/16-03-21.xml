<hi>I received the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. The <persName xml:id="2785">Bishop of Jarrow</persName> was celebrant. I spent the morning in writing the sermon for next Sunday. After lunch I walked round Houghall Wood with the Bp. of Jarrow. We left cards on Major Wynne &amp; Major <persName xml:id="3922">Johnson</persName>. I attended Evensong. <persName xml:id="2920">Gee</persName> came to say Goodbye before going away for a month. I gave him a copy of <ref xml:id="85">"Robertson"</ref>, and also (at his own request) my photograph. <persName xml:id="2950">Turner</persName> came to tea. He is staying with <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName>, and working away at a treatise on Apostolic Succession. I received by the afternoon post a letter from the Bishop of Hereford, acknowledging a copy of "Robertson". </hi> <hi rend="bold underline">He bewails the fact that I am not a Bishop in the Southern province</hi><hi>: &amp; wonders who "runs" <persName xml:id="215">Asquith's</persName> episcopal appointments! Then I revised my <persName xml:id="3959">Warburton</persName> paper: &amp; made some attempt to reform my disordered room. Also I wrote a series of letters.</hi>
