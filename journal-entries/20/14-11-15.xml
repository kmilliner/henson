<hi>At day&#8211;break the country was vested in white, &amp; a considerable snow&#8211;storm was in progress &#8211; an ill promise for this afternoon's service! In spite of this, we motored to Sunderland, where I preached in the Parish Church to the Mayor &amp; Corporation.<ref xml:id="887"></ref> There was scarcely anybody else in the congregation! After service we went to a Boys' School hard by the Church, &amp; there took part in a little function of welcoming the Mayor &amp; thanking the Preacher. We then returned to Durham through driving rain, which rapidly cleared off the snow. On arriving at the Deanery I received a message from the Chief Constable to say that the troops at Cocken would not attend the service in the Cathedral owing to the weather. Reeves brought me a copy of a telegram from French announcing that</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> <persName xml:id="218">Lord Roberts</persName> had died of pneumonia in France, whither he had gone to visit the Indian troops</hi><hi>. I wrote a brief preface to my sermon to do some justice to these new circumstances. There was a larger congregation in the Cathedral than, perhaps, might have been expected, &amp; the khaki uniforms were fairly numerous. I preached from the words of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> James: "</hi><hi rend="underline">So speak ye, &amp; so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty"</hi><hi>. I incidentally pressed for an earlier closing of the public houses. The new Mayoress &amp; her daughter came in to tea bringing the Mayor's excuses on the score that </hi><hi rend="underline">he was too wet</hi><hi>! Later I went to the Town&#8211;Hall accompanied by <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName> in order to fulfil my promise to give a ten&#8211;minute address to the soldiers who, it was supposed, would have thronged to a mingled&#8211;entertainment provided by the <orgName xml:id="239">Y.M.C.A.</orgName> About 30, mainly officers were present: two solos were sung: &amp; everybody felt a two&#8211;fold humidity &#8211; the rain &amp; a 'fizzle&#8211;out'!</hi>
