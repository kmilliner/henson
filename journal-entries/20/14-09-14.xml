<hi>A cloudy boisterous day, most comfortless and hustling. The morning papers are cheerful reading, though they add nothing to our knowledge of the military situation. </hi><hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="1259">Reggie Still</persName></hi><hi> writes to say that he has enlisted for service during the war. </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Sir <persName xml:id="3138">Frank Brown</persName></hi><hi rend="italic"> asked me to come to the Shire Hall at 4 p.m. I went &amp; wasted an hour in talking about the organisation of sewing meetings in the county!! The plain truth is what nobody dare state, though the military authorities come as near stating it as they decently can, that this great outburst of feminine activity since the war began is mainly troublesome, &amp;, so far as its output is concerned, mostly superfluous.</hi>

<hi>The senior lay&#8211;vicar brought me 10/&#8211; from the lay&#8211;vicars to add to yesterday's offertory. They have agreed to subscribe one shilling weekly apiece to the Relief Funds during the War. </hi>
