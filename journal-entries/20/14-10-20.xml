<hi>Twelve years ago on this day <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I exchanged vows in the Abbey. We have traversed much broken ground in the interval, and had our full portion of disillusionment &amp; failure. Yet, like the British Army, we are still in being, &amp; ready to go forward. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I gave her <persName xml:id="5">Baxter's</persName> <ref xml:id="259">"Breviate of his wife's life"</ref> as an offering "to another very excellent wife from another very quaint husband".</hi><hi> I attended both services in the cathedral in <persName xml:id="473">Knowling's</persName> stead. After Mattins I spent two hours in the Cathedral with <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName>, looking at the MSS.</hi>

He was most in his element as a novelist, though his romances were spoiled by his ardour for proselytizing. I remember that he preached for me in the Abbey shortly after I came to Westminster, &amp; impressed me as an ill&#8211;balanced hysterical creature. But he had a literary gift.</hi>
