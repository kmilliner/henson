<hi>I went to the Cathedral at 8 a.m., and celebrated the Holy Communion. There was a considerable gathering of nunlike women headed by <persName xml:id="3844">Hockley</persName> in his cassock. He is holding a retreat for them. </hi><hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="3496">Dennett</persName> came to report the illness of the choirboy Jackson</hi><hi>, and to get authority to summon a specialist from Newcastle. Later the lad was examined, adjudged to have appendicitis, &amp; ordered to be operated on forthwith. For this purpose he was removed to the hospital. I lunched with the <persName xml:id="2785">Bishop of Jarrow</persName>, and afterwards walked with him to St. Oswald's, and there attended the funeral service of one of the sub&#8211;vergers, Usher. Then I returned, and attended Evensong. In the course of a short walk I fell in with a wounded soldier, &amp; brought him back for tea at the Deanery. His name was Reggie Lomas, and he was a member of the Battalion of the K.R.R. wholly composed of <orgName xml:id="255">Church Brigade</orgName> Boys. Then I wrote to <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName>. Going to fetch an evening paper, I fell in with Professor How, and had some conversation with him about ecclesiastical matters. Then I dined, and afterwards wasted my time until nearly midnight by reading the publications of the <orgName xml:id="295">"Society of St. Peter &amp; Paul"</orgName>.</hi>
