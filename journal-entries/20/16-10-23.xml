<hi rend="italic">I fear I may have shocked this mild little apostle, the <persName xml:id="532">Bishop of Ely</persName>, by my reckless talk, but there was method in my madness. I was trying to make one bishop understand how the Episcopal Policy really looks to those who are not members of the "Farnham Ring", and do not belong to any of the great parties. I was pleased that he came to the Cathedral last night, &amp; heard my sermon, just in order that he might have some other notion of me than that of an "Episcopoklastes" or Bishop&#8211;bruizer!</hi>

<hi>Mine host accompanied me into the City, guided me to a barber where I had my Samsonic locks curtailed, &amp; finally saw me off at the station. The train left Manchester at 11.30 a.m. and proceeded without change to Durham, arriving fairly to the scheduled time at 3.23 p.m. At York the <persName xml:id="2785">Bishop of Jarrow</persName> came into the train.</hi>
