<hi>I shewed <persName xml:id="3877">Pollard</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3878">his wife</persName> through the cathedral &amp; library after service: as they were bidding us farewell in the Hall, Eric <persName xml:id="3819">Maclagan</persName> with a friend appeared seeking permission to see the library, &amp; therein especially the Cuthbert relics. I accompanied them, &amp; spent the rest of the morning with them. Their enthusiastic admiration of the Cuthbert vestments amused &amp; impressed me. They stayed to lunch, &amp; were very agreeable company. </hi><hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="77">Marion</persName> &amp; I walked round the wood:</hi><hi> and then I attended Evensong. <persName xml:id="2806">Bayley</persName> excused himself on the plea of a chill: &amp; <persName xml:id="2800">Culley</persName> took his place. Everybody came to supper except one of Cornish &amp; <persName xml:id="3526" display="no">Gaymer's</persName> men. Thus the company numbered 43. The toasts were 1. The King &#8211; we sang a verse of the National Anthem. 2. The Chapter workmen, proposed by the <persName xml:id="2785">Bishop of Jarrow</persName> &amp; responded to by <persName xml:id="2791">Browne</persName>. 3. The Vergers, Sub&#8211;Vergers, &amp; Bell&#8211;ringers, proposed by <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName>, &amp; responded to by <persName xml:id="2809">Freeman</persName>. 4. Cornish &amp; Gaymer's Workmen, proposed by Culley, &amp; responded to by <persName xml:id="3498" display="no">Payne</persName>. 5. Dean &amp; Chapter, proposed by <persName xml:id="3820">Jopling</persName>, &amp; responded to by myself. The company dispersed about 10.45 p.m. On the whole, I think the function went off well.</hi>
