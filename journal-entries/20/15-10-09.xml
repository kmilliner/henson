<hi rend="italic">I wrote to Mary <persName xml:id="1204">Radford</persName>: also to <persName xml:id="225">Bernard</persName>, congratulating him on his election to the Archbishoprick of Dublin: also to <persName xml:id="2785">Quirk</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName>. We bade farewell to <persName xml:id="76">Mother</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="77">Marion</persName> after lunch, &amp; motored to Minster, where we took the train to Canterbury, &amp; arrived shortly after 5 p.m. The weather had changed for the worse, so that our journey was accomplished under rain. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">Awaiting me were several more letters of protest against my S. Nicholas Sermon</hi><hi rend="italic">. Evidently a very savage &amp; intractable temper is more widely distributed than I had thought possible. Major Dewhurst came to dine. He has been at the Front in Flanders, &amp; discussed the military situation in a very interesting way. On the whole he certainly was not optimistic. The deficiency of our Staff service especially was dwelt upon as the real cause of our failures both in Flanders &amp; at the Dardanelles.</hi>
