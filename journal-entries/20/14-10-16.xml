<hi>I worked at my sermon all the morning, &amp; finally finished it in the evening. In the afternoon I attended the meeting of the <orgName xml:id="227">Sherburn Governors</orgName>. Then I motored the Mayor to see the <persName xml:id="3528">Salvesons</persName><persName xml:id="3529"></persName> [Salvins]: to find out how far they could undertake to accommodate the refugees from Belgium. We practically promised to guarantee funds for another 50: that means &#x00A3;350. I said that I myself would give &#x00A3;10. Where the money is to come from I cannot imagine! The news is to hand tonight that another cruizer has been destroyed by submarines in the North Sea. Nearly 500 men &amp; boys have perished. This is the noble policy of "attrition"!</hi>
