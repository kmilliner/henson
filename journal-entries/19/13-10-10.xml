<persName xml:id="648">Car&#x00F6;e</persName> went after an early breakfast, in the course of which he gave me much rather disconcerting information about <persName xml:id="3444">Macartney</persName> &amp; his methods. <persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName> took his departure at 11 a.m. for Edinburgh. <persName xml:id="2533">Bishop Nickson</persName> came to talk to me about arranging my stable as a motor garage. I wrote a series of letters, &amp; so frittered away the morning.

In the afternoon I attended Evensong in the Cathedral, walked with Logic, &amp; had a long interview with Bishops <persName xml:id="555">Tucker</persName> and <persName xml:id="3445">Tugwell</persName>. <hi rend="italic">The latter is very decided in his condemnation of the liquor traffic in Southern Nigeria, &amp; protests eagerly against <persName xml:id="3434">Morel's</persName> laudation of the Mohammedans in that part of Africa. </hi>

<persName xml:id="3446" display="no">Noel</persName> came &amp; wrote letters after dinner.
