<persName xml:id="636">Pearce</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2109" display="no">his sister</persName> went off after breakfast. I made a vain effort to write a sermon on 'the Venerable Bede' for the function at Sunderland next week: but soon gave it up, as I had a headache. The "Times" devotes three columns to the review of <persName xml:id="3550">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Parnell's</persName> book about her deplorable <persName xml:id="3549">husband's</persName> passion for herself, which ruined both his reputation &amp; his policy. In all the scarlet records of lawless passion it would be deficient to find a parallel to so extreme &amp; blinding an infatuation. There are many side&#8211;lights of the squalid story of the "Home Rule" movement which show English statesmen in a queer situation.
