<hi rend="italic">I received a very kind letter from the <persName xml:id="128">Archbishop of Canterbury</persName>, </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">accepting my resignation as well from the Committee on Prayer&#8211;Book Reform, as from that on the Representation of the Laity.</hi></p>
         <p>
To pacify <persName xml:id="112">Ella's</persName> apprehensions, <persName xml:id="3099">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Stuart</persName> came &amp; sounded me. He found nothing wrong.

<persName xml:id="3470">Canon Sykes</persName> came to ask me to preside over the <orgName xml:id="96">Church Defence Committee</orgName> in place of the <persName xml:id="276">Bishop of Durham</persName>, who had gone to the funeral of <persName xml:id="3511">Canon Ross&#8211;Lewin</persName>. I consented, and wasted the afternoon in <persName xml:id="2820">Bishop Cosin's</persName> Library discussing a tiresome &amp; exhausted controversy. I only "shewed my teeth" once when I advised the Committee not to mix up support of the Church Schools with "Church Defence". Sykes protested hotly, but was defeated when the matter was put to the vote.</p>
         <p>
We dined with <persName xml:id="3512">Colonel Darwin</persName>. It was quite a small party. Besides ourselves were only the <persName xml:id="2837">Pembertons</persName><persName xml:id="2843"></persName>. We went to &amp; fro in the new car, which travelled well enough, but was too noisy.</p>
