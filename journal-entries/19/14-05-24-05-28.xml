The morning was bright, but later the clouds gathered. There was a very large congregation in the cathedral, &amp; I noticed the unusually considerable proportion of men. <persName xml:id="712">M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Adam Muir</persName> &amp; three assistants conducted the service. I <ref xml:id="771">preached</ref> in my surplice as mine host suggested. My text was 2. Cor: IV. 5. "We preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, &amp; ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake". After service the members of the Kirk session were very appreciative in their comments. <hi rend="italic">One of them handed me a cheque for eight guineas which I added immediately to the Offertory.</hi> Then we inspected the wonderful crypt of the cathedral, &amp; returned home.

During the afternoon I called on <persName xml:id="2188">old M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Story</persName>, the widow of the <persName xml:id="895">late Principal</persName> of Glasgow University. In spite of her 86 years, the old lady is full of interest, and very bright. Here I learned the gratifying intelligence that the Unionists have carried Ipswich by a majority of over 500 votes. It is not a 'landslide', but may indicate a considerable change in public opinion. It is also a notable rebuff to that brace of wind&#8211;bags, <persName xml:id="234">Lloyd George</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="890">Masterman</persName>, both of whom have deserved very ill of the English People.

<hi>The rain fell heavily as the time of evening service approached. We arrived at the cathedral in a tropical deluge. Notwithstanding this, there was a very large congregation, many standing throughout. I preached from the Apocalypse: "I saw no temple therein", and dwelt on the provisional &amp; prophetic character of all ecclesiastical arrangements. There were 20 ministers among my hearers. The assistants of M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">c</hi><hi>Adam Muir impressed me as very promising young men. Their names were <persName xml:id="1897" display="no">Thompson</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1903" display="no">Mackenzie</persName>.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="1914">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Strong</persName>, lately Minister of Hillhead church, came to supper. He expressed himself about the Union of the Churches with marked lack of sympathy. There can be no doubt that the opposition in both churches has become organized &amp; vocal: but what amount of support it can count upon remains to be disclosed. The leading men in both churches are clearly very eager to carry through the Union: and they are well&#8211;supported by the laity generally.

<hi>On Monday, May 25</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> 1914, I returned to Durham: and was followed on Tuesday by <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName>.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>On Wednesday, May 27</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1914, we motored to Sunderland, &amp;, after lunching with >M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Fraser, the Vicar of the Venerable Bede Church, I preached &amp; dedicated two memorial windows in the said church. Then we adjourned to a new Hall &amp; Institute, built by a bequest from an eccentric old workman named Jeffrey. My wife declared these buildings open, &amp; received a silver cup from the Architect. After the function we motored back to Durham.

On Thursday, the 28<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> May, <persName xml:id="3470">Canon Sykes</persName>, with Mess<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Jubb &amp; Bodington lunched here, and afterwards laid before me their appeal for the Schools of the Diocese. <hi rend="bold underline">I told them that I could not personally assist them, but that I should place no hindrance in the way of the Chapter's action, if they wished to make a contribution.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> [sic â€“ space left intentionally blank] an Indian Missionary, commended by the <persName xml:id="1123">Bishop of Southampton</persName>, also lunched. He wished me to pass a judgement on a work which he had composed. But I declined to do so, &amp; referred him to <persName xml:id="117">Rashdall</persName>!

<persName xml:id="2127">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Car&#x00F6;e</persName> arrived during the afternoon. After dinner we attended a musical evening party given by the <persName xml:id="590">Archdeacon</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2762">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Watkins</persName>.
