I travelled from Durham to Cardiff, changing trains at Gloucester, where also was a wait of half an hour, which I utilized in getting a cup of tea from a very uncivil maiden in the "First Class Refreshment" room. <hi rend="italic">Just before the train left for Cardiff, a pleasant&#8211;faced young railway porter thrust his head into the carriage window, &amp; thus addressed me: "Beg pardon, Sir, but haven't I heard you preach in Westminster Abbey?"  I replied that he might have enjoyed that privilege any time during recent years. He said that his father had been one of the vergers at the Abbey, &amp; died in 1900 &#8211; the year when I was appointed to a Canonry.</hi>

<persName xml:id="346">Henderson</persName> met me on the platform at Cardiff. There was a pleasant little domestic dinner party. Eileen, Alan's sister, has grown into a young woman: indeed she is now nearly 26 years old, and it is 9 years since I saw her. James, <persName xml:id="30">Arthur Shadwell's</persName> brother in law, &amp; a friend of <persName xml:id="22">W. P. Ker</persName>, was of the party; &amp; a pleasant looking parson, named, I think, Davies.
