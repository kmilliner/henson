A dull rainy day, in which everything looked at its worst. I celebrated at midday. After lunch &#8211; to which came the excellent <persName xml:id="2806">Bailey</persName> &#8211; I shewed the Library to my guests. In the evening I went out to Sherburn, &amp; there preached to a large congregation. The sermon was a failure for I was feeling played out, &amp; the people were plainly unaccustomed to my kind of preaching.

<hi rend="italic">I noticed on the parson's table &#8211; his name is <persName xml:id="3440">Parkinson</persName>; he is a glum person, but his wife talks mightily &#8211; a copy of the "Church Times". It contains some hostile &amp; belittling references to the Dean of Durham!!</hi> I drove back to the Deanery immediately after the service, &amp; arrived in time for the Sunday dinner.
