<hi>Time hath, my Lord, a wallet at his back</hi>

<hi>Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,</hi>

<hi>A great&#8211;sized monster of ingratitudes:</hi>

<hi>Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devour'd</hi>

         <p><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I walked to the railway station to take part in giving their Majesties a good 'send&#8211;off'. Everybody who was anybody was on the platform. I had some talk with old <persName xml:id="3137">John Wilson</persName>, who was evidently much pleased by the Queen's visit to the "Aged Miners' Homes". <hi rend="italic">"Whatever republicanism there was in the men's minds was pushed back some years by that visit," he said. H.M. seems to have done the right thing, &amp; done it well. The King looked well, &amp; was very gracious to everybody beginning with the Mayor, &amp; going round the circle. He spoke to me with much friendliness,</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline"> "I read your letter in the "Times" about these women: it's the best letter I ever read"!</hi><hi rend="italic"> I could but express my satisfaction. The King said that he regretted he had not been able to accompany the Queen on her visit to the Cathedral: &amp; that he hoped to visit the Cathedral on his next visit.</hi>

         <p>We lunched with <persName xml:id="3506">Miss Tristram</persName>: <persName xml:id="3507">Bishop Taylor Smith</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="555">Bp.

         <p><hi rend="italic">I went to the opening of the Sale of Work at S. Hild's Training College, &amp; said a few words in introduction of <persName xml:id="2817">Lady Londonderry</persName>. She told me that she had repeated to <persName xml:id="2278">Bonar Law</persName> my suggestion as to the parallel between the situation of the Army in 1688 &amp; at the present time. It duly reappeared in the Dublin speech.</hi><note xml:id="169" n="2"></note></p>
