<hi rend="bold">[</hi>I went across to Lambeth on Saturday morning in order to make some preparation in the library there for my evidence before the select committee. I had an interview with his <persName xml:id="128">Grace</persName>, &amp; then settled to read such books as were relevant. <persName xml:id="44"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Armitage Robinson</hi></persName> arrived, &amp; we discussed the subject. <hi rend="italic">I stayed to luncheon, &amp; sate at table between the 2 Abps. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">The Primate pleasantly compared himself &amp; his <persName xml:id="130">northern brother</persName> to two tame elephants, bringing in a capture</hi><hi rend="i bold">!</hi> <hi rend="italic">We discussed the desperate political situation, &amp; the strange frivolity which marked the course of society. The Archbishop mentioned as a case in point the behaviour of the <persName xml:id="215">Prime Minister</persName>, who continued to play bridge with young women until the small hours of the morning, at a juncture which at any moment might emerge in civil war, a situation which would overwhelm the country with disaster, and himself with infamy.

<hi>We left Winchester for Southampton by a morning rain, arriving in good time for lunch. We stayed with the <persName xml:id="1123">Bishop&#8211;Suffragan</persName> until Saturday, and enjoyed some delightful motor drives through the forest. </hi>

<hi>On Thursday we visited Salisbury. Here we called at the Palace, and had some conversation with the <persName xml:id="178">Bishop</persName>. He spoke rather contemptuously of his <persName xml:id="1218">Brother</persName> of Chelmsford, who seems to be shaping for the usual transformation which overtakes the Evangelical on the Episcopal Bench. We visited Breamore, where is a most interesting church, largely prae&#8211;Norman. There is a round arch with a clear&#8211;cut Anglo&#8211;Saxon inscription: and some medieval frescoes in the priest's chamber within the porch.</hi>

On Saturday, we left Southampton, and made our way to Vann, in order to spend the week&#8211;end with the <persName xml:id="648"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Car&#x00F6;es</hi></persName><persName xml:id="2127"></persName>. In the afternoon our hosts took us on an expedition to Bignor, to see the remains of the Roman Villa. The mosaic pavements are astonishingly brilliant.
