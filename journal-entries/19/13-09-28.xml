A beautiful day but very warm. I preached at Mattins in Highfield Church from the words of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> James: "<hi rend="underline">The wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God</hi>". There was a crowded congregation, among which <persName xml:id="106">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Talbot</persName> the <persName xml:id="105">Bishop's</persName> wife was conspicuous. The church is an oddly constructed building, &amp; its acoustics are far from good: but the people were very attentive, &amp; (I was assured) that they could all hear the sermon. A "Yorkshire Post" journalist borrowed the <ref xml:id="734">M.S.</ref> after service.
         </p>
         <p>
After lunch we walked to the South Hill, Bassett, but failed to find the <persName xml:id="1123">Bishop</persName> or his <persName xml:id="3422" display="no">sister</persName> at home.
         </p>
         <p>
Lady Elibank came to tea: also the <persName xml:id="3426">Master</persName> of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Cross, Winchester, who preaches in Highfield tonight.
         </p>
         <p>
At Evensong I preached in S. Luke's from the words; "<hi rend="underline">They marvelled that He was speaking with a woman</hi>".
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">I discussed the equality of the sexes, &amp; took occasion to make some severe references to the fanatical Suffragists, &amp; especially the clergy who champion them. There was a very large congregation, which listened to rather a long sermon with exemplary attention. The Bishop of Southampton was present, &amp; also the chaplain of the Bishop of Winchester. The Churchwardens seemed well&#8211;pleased, &amp; begged me to come again.</hi>
