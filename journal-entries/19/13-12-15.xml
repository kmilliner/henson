<hi rend="bold underline">The 'Times' publishes a letter by <persName xml:id="3520">Canon Mason</persName> on the Kikuyu Conference</hi>. It is a specious composition designed as an answer to the <persName xml:id="276">Bishop of Durham</persName>. <hi rend="bold underline">I wrote a letter to the 'Editor' recalling the real point at issue: but I doubt whether he will publish it.</hi>

<hi>I journeyed to Tynemouth, &amp; there addressed a meeting of the <orgName xml:id="207">C.E.M.S.</orgName> on the Church of England. The men listened with politeness, &amp; applauded with moderate fervour. On the whole 'twas rather a dull proceeding. <persName xml:id="3521">Holmes</persName>, who is now Vicar of Tynemouth, has grown thin &amp; almost hairless. Since I visited him in South Shields some 15 years ago, he has become the father of a daughter, now a girl of ten. I caught the 9.55 express from Newcastle, and arrived at Durham about 10.20 p.m. <persName xml:id="3513">Cummings</persName> met me with the car at the station.</hi>
