<hi>A most glorious day from beginning to end. I noticed that a new nest was being built in the garden. If this is finished, there will be 16 nests established in 4 trees viz: 2, 6, 7, 1, in order. I wrote divers letters, &amp; then </hi><hi rend="bold underline">we started in the motor for Singleton Park, Kendal</hi><hi>, where </hi><hi rend="bold underline">we were pledged to visit </hi><persName xml:id="93"><hi rend="bold underline">D</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> &amp; </hi><persName xml:id="94"><hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">rs</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Jackson</hi></persName><hi>. We drove through Stanhope, Alston, Penrith, &amp; Kendal. The tremendous hill before we came to Alston was almost too much for the car. We got out &amp; walked in order to lighten the car. At Alston we lunched comfortably at the Blue Bell Inn: &amp; then went forward over an admirable road. The country through which we passed was ravishingly beautiful. Everywhere richly&#8211;fleeced sheep, &amp; lambs. We encountered many oxen on the road, stupid &amp; impracticable beasts driven by stupid &amp; impracticable drovers.</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">We reached Singleton Park at 5.30 p.m</hi><hi>. Here we discovered that unwittingly we had brought away with us Kenneth Campbell's portmanteau. If its weight might indicate its contents, it was full of his books. We returned it by passenger train to Euston at a cost 4/2. We dined quietly with our host &amp; hostess.</hi>
