<hi>I celebrated in the cathedral at 8 a.m.</hi>

<hi>The "Times" becomes so interesting with its reports of the crisis that my working power is appreciably lessened! <persName xml:id="3470">Canon Sykes</persName> lunched here, and we both afterwards attended a meeting of the <orgName xml:id="96">Church Defence Committee</orgName>.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Then I attended Evensong.</hi>

<hi rend="italic bold underline">After dinner <persName xml:id="2174">Bishop Willis</persName> came to consult me about the memorandum he is preparing for the Lambeth Conference Committee</hi><hi rend="italic">. He had just come from the <persName xml:id="130">Archbishop of York</persName>, whose greetings he brought. He said that he </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">had recently had a private interview with <persName xml:id="3469">Bishop Weston</persName>, who seemed 'on the verge of a nervous break&#8211;down</hi><hi rend="italic">'. He thought that he (Weston) had received severe handling from his friends. These, indeed, can hardly be unconscious of the discredit he has brought on their "Catholic" theory.</hi>
