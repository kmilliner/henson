We spent the day in attending the Congress.
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">The general subject at all three sessions was "</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">The Kingdom &amp; the Sexes</hi><hi rend="italic">". In the forenoon <persName xml:id="114">Bishop Welldon</persName> led off with a vigorous paper on the Ideal of Manhood. He was followed by three ladies, of whom two were suffragists: the third, <persName xml:id="3433">Miss Soulsby</persName>, spoke excellent good sense of the now antiquated type. The discussion, if such it could be called, was poor enough. A succession of young women bleated the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">suffragist&#8211;nonsense</hi><hi rend="italic"> in variant degrees of absurdity. Even so the "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">debate</hi><hi rend="italic">" waned, &amp; flickered out before the appointed time for it to close.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">The afternoon was literally a fiasco. The speakers were slips of silly girls, &amp; the most wonderful parsons. Everybody was conscious of the grotesque unreality of the "discussion".</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
We dined together pleasantly at "The Star", &amp; then attended the evening session. The <persName xml:id="1123">Bishop of Southampton</persName> led off with a fanatical paper. <ref xml:id="735">I followed</ref> &amp; was very fairly listened to. Then the discussion began, but we came away to catch the train: &amp; so heard little of it.
