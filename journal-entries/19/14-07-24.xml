<hi rend="underline">Chapter meeting:</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I read to the Chapter the letter which I had received from the five junior lay&#8211;clerks: and I asked two things</hi>.<hi> 1) that the 10 per cent increase on their stipends already granted to the seniors should be extended to them: and 2) that a Committee of Chapter should be appointed to consider the conditions under which the lay&#8211;vicars hold office. These were agreed to: and later in the day, I received the aggrieved lay&#8211;clerks in the Chapter&#8211;house, the Canons being present, &amp; addressed them. I announced the decision of the D. &amp; C.; assured them that they should have full opportunity of stating their views to the Committee: and rebuked them for the tone of their letter.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>We appointed another Committee to consider a request of the Workmen for increase of wages.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I promised to have the Cope&#8211;case placed in the Library in the place of the case there.</hi>
