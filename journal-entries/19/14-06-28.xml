<hi>I celebrated at 8 a.m. At Mattins the <persName xml:id="1273">Judges</persName><persName xml:id="3403"></persName> attended service in state. The sermon (a good one) was preached by the High Sheriff's chaplain, the Vicar of Croxdale. After service we all walked for an hour. The High Sheriff (M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> <hi><persName xml:id="1237">Priestman</persName>) &amp; his chaplain came to lunch. After they had departed, I showed <persName xml:id="503">Winifrid</persName>, <persName xml:id="2056">Elsie</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> over the Cathedral.

<hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName> sent me a cutting from "The Oxford Review" [Oct: 26</hi><hi rend="i sup u">th</hi><hi rend="italic"> 1887] of a letter of mine headed <ref xml:id="768" display="no">'The Gladstonian Meeting at the Corn Exchange from a Home Ruler's point of view'</ref>. It is a very curious document, which I had totally forgotten. In it I say: "I believe firmly that the permanent solution of the Irish problem will only be found in the concession of self&#8211;government to Ireland.["</hi><hi rend="italic">] I held this view before M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">r</hi> <hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="879">Gladstone</persName> brought forward his delusive &amp; inadequate proposals, &amp; I hold it still. But I hate &amp; scorn the Parnellite tactics: all the more because they have retarded &amp; disgraced so worthy a causeâ€¦ it is certain that until Home Rule becomes honourable it will not succeed.'
