         <p>I shewed our guests over the library after breakfast, &amp; then sent them to the Castle under <persName xml:id="112">Ella's</persName> escort, while I attended the Chapter&#8211;meeting. <hi rend="bold underline">The <persName xml:id="2864">Clarkes</persName><persName xml:id="2942" display="no"></persName> went off about 2.30 p.m. <persName xml:id="636">Pearce</persName> &amp; I attended Evensong in the Cathedral. Then some black men from Uganda, escorted by a Roman Catholic Bishop, came to the Cathedral, &amp; afterwards had tea in the Deanery. When they had taken their departure, Pearce &amp; I walked to the Blue&#8211;bells, which are still wonderful. Then we dined in the Castle, &amp; had much talk with <persName xml:id="2920">Gee</persName>.</hi></p>
