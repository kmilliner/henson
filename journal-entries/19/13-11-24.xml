         <p>I left Worcester under bright sunshine by the 10.9 train, being accompanied to the station by Miss Williams, an agreeable young lady who is also a bell&#8211;ringer. Our train was delayed by the necessity of giving place to the Royal 'special', which was carrying their Majesties from Windsor to Lambton. A young lady got into the carriage, who soon revealed the fact that she was on her way to Lambton to join the house party in welcoming Their Majesties! I arrived something after 5 p.m.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="3446" display="no">Noel</persName> came to write letters for me. I sent off to Hugh Rees a bundle of 8 sermons to be made up into a little volume for presentation as a Christmas gift.</p>
