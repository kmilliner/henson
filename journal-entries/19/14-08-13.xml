         <p>The post brought me a truly alarming communication from Mess<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, the printers &amp; publishers of the <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> Records: The total expenditure for the 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> vol: only = &#x00A3;835, besides the payment to the editor (&#x00A3;200) &amp; to Miss Redstone &amp; others (&#x00A3;144). Thus one volume will have cost the enormous sum of &#x00A3;1179.2.3. I set aside &#x00A3;1000 for <hi rend="underline">both</hi> volumes! Thus I am still indebted to the publishers to the extent of &#x00A3;635; &amp; they ask for a cheque on account.</p>
         <p>I wrote at once to <persName xml:id="2110">Burke</persName> asking for a statement, and an explanation.</p>
         <p>Misfortunes never come alone. Before the day was ended two more huge &amp; unexpected bills came, from <persName xml:id="3514">Laidler</persName> &amp; Richardson, raising my indebtedness by more than &#x00A3;200. And then there is the Prince of Wales's <orgName xml:id="278">National Relief Fund</orgName>, to which I cannot contribute less than &#x00A3;100.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold">[253]</hi></p>
         <p>After tea we motored to the coast from Seaham to Whitburn in order to see the trenches which the Territorials have been digging against an attack of the Germans. As we passed through Sunderland the townspeople were all agape with excitement by reason of that sinister war&#8211;fowl, an aeroplane, which soared high above their city.</p>
         <p>On returning to Durham I attended a meeting of the Committee of the newly constituted Emergency Force. I made a suggestion that volunteers for the harvesting of the crops should be invited. This was supported by <persName xml:id="3137">John Wilson</persName>, who forthwith volunteered to have a letter issued to the branches of the miners' association. This letter was signed by the Mayor, Wilson, &amp; myself.</p>
         <p>After we had gone to bed on Friday, the 14<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> inst, There arrived a telegram from <persName xml:id="3505" display="no">Frau K&#x00F6;rsteiner</persName> in Zurich stating that <persName xml:id="76">Mother</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="77">Marion</persName> were at G&#x00F6;ttingen. It may be probably inferred that they are staying with Mother's relatives: &amp; there they had best continue for the present.</p>
