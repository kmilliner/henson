<hi>The news from the French frontier continues to be rather disconcerting. It seems plain enough that the Allies, in spite of desperate fighting, are not able to hold back the German forces, which are in overwhelming strength. The British contingent is doing nobly, but is clearly outnumbered &amp; over&#8211;pressed. The Government makes the very important announcement that native Indian troops are to be employed. It is held that there would be grave discontent in India if, while the French employed their African troops, we refused to give our Indians a 'look in'. The reasoning is cogent, &amp; probably sound: nevertheless the appearance of Asiaticks on the soil of Europe must needs be regarded as regrettable, and will be exploited to the full by the Germans. On this point, American feeling is dangerously sensitive. The casualty lists are still with&#8211;holden. We are only permitted to know that they grow longer every day. There are many signs of restiveness provoked by the severe economy of news practised by the Press Bureau: it is maintained, not perhaps unreasonably, that the lack of information is telling unfavourably on the recruiting for Kitchener's new Army. The public wants its comforting 'purple patches'.</hi>
