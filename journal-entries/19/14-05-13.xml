         <p><hi rend="italic bold underline">The morning post brought me from the Author, <persName xml:id="359">Sanday's</persName> <persName xml:id="745">Reply</persName> to <persName xml:id="49">Gore</persName>. I read it through with eager interest. It is certainly a very impressive document</hi><hi rend="italic">. The old Professor shakes off the ambiguous habit of his later years, &amp; reverts to the vigourous independence of his earlier manhood. He declares himself on the side of the Modernists with candour and decision. If Gore has not wholly lost the sense of proportion, he must feel some disquietude at thus throwing into open opposition a Scholar, so eminent, so respected, and so devout. The facile applause of an ignoramus like <persName xml:id="2462">Watts&#8211;Ditchfield</persName> is sorry compensation for the alienation of Sanday. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">I fear the publication of this 'Reply' makes a crisis unavoidable</hi><hi rend="italic">. It ought to take the form of a Trial for Heresy, but the Fanaticks could hardly place the most venerated Teacher in Great Britain in the dock! Yet, Gore </hi><hi rend="italic underline">must</hi><hi rend="italic"> do something on pain of becoming ridiculous.</hi>
