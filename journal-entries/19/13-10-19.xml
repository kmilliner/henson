The glorious weather continues. I received the Sacrament in the Cathedral. <persName xml:id="2692">Budworth</persName> celebrated. The boys of the <orgName xml:id="234">Grammar School</orgName> communicated in large numbers.

I was motored out to Sacriston where I preached to a large congregation in the parish church. The occasion was a Church Parade of Territorials, Army Reserve, Ambulance, and Boy Scouts. Everybody was most attentive. I returned to the Deanery immediately after the service.

I attended Evensong in the cathedral.

We all motored to Pittington Church, where I preached to a very large congregation which had come together to keep a Harvest Festival. The acoustic qualities of this fine church appear to be excellent.
