<hi rend="italic">There was but a small congregation. After service </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">I had an interview with <persName xml:id="2174">Bishop Willis</persName>, whom I counselled to take a firm attitude towards the <persName xml:id="105">Bishop of Winchester</persName></hi><hi rend="italic">. I insisted that he was now the representative of Evangelical principles: that he must not assent to any course which could be interpreted as a withdrawal from the position which he had taken up: that the charge of heresy, which had been deliberately formulated &amp; published must be categorically &amp; publicly withdrawn. I gave him <ref xml:id="383">"The Road to Unity"</ref>, <ref xml:id="372">"Ecclesiastica"</ref>, and <ref xml:id="27">"Moral Discipline in the Christian Church"</ref>. He expressed himself very grateful to me for taking up his defence.</hi>
