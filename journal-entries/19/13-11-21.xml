Then I went to <hi rend="underline">Stock</hi>'s lecture on Printed Books before 1500, and went on to the Town Hall, where I gave certificates to the boys of the <orgName xml:id="234">Johnston School</orgName>, and made a speech. The new Mayor was there, &amp; moved a vote of thanks to me very flatterously.
