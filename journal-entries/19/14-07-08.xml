<hi>I went to my dentist at Newcastle, &amp; spent an hour with him. Then I went to the barber, &amp; had my hair cut &amp; shampooed. After this I returned to Durham, and made my dispositions for departure. I travelled to town by the 5.5 [sic] p.m. express. At York I was joined by the <persName xml:id="130">Archbishop of York</persName>, with whom I had much conversation on the road. On my arrival at King's Cross I drove at once to <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName>, where I was kindly received by <persName xml:id="636">Pearce</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2109" display="no">his sister</persName>. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> was awaiting my arrival.</hi>
