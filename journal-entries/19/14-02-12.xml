<hi>At <persName xml:id="473">Knowling's</persName> request I celebrated the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. All the Chapter were present except <persName xml:id="2533">Nickson</persName>, who is in Wales, and I think every family in the College was represented.</hi>

<hi>At 1 p.m. the Funeral took place. The <persName xml:id="276">Bishop</persName> read the lesson, &amp; gave the Benediction. <persName xml:id="590">Watkins</persName> read some of the prayers, &amp; I read the concluding prayer. All was very Christian &amp; solemn. The little man bore himself well throughout. </hi>
