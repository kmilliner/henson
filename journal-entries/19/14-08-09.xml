         <p>At 9.30 a.m. <persName xml:id="3525">Colonel Doyle</persName> brought 400 Artillerymen to a special service in the Cathedral. The singing of the hymns was very vigorous, and to me at least extremely moving. Indeed I had hard work to master my emotion. However I managed to <ref xml:id="772">preach</ref> a short sermon on the words: <hi rend="bold underline">"Suffer hardship with me as a good soldier of Christ Jesus"</hi>. The men sang "God Save the King" with much fervour before leaving the Cathedral.
