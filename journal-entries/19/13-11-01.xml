After breakfast I wrote letters, and then took <persName xml:id="65">Lord Chelmsford</persName> for a walk round Magdalen &amp; Christ Church walks. After lunch I walked with <persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName>, and with <persName xml:id="771">Mowbray</persName>. The beauty of the autumnal colourings is exquisite. Then I went to tea with <persName xml:id="2128">Olaf Caröe</persName> in Magdalen, &amp; there talked for more than an hour with Campbell &amp; Simpson, two of Olaf's friends. Finally I returned to my room &amp; read over my sermon for tomorrow.

There was a large party at dinner. In the common room I had much conversation with <persName xml:id="40"><hi rend="bold underline">Graham–Harrison</hi></persName>; and afterwards with the <persName xml:id="228">Warden's</persName> party. The electric lighting of the Hall is in the experimental stage, &amp; cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory.
