<hi><persName xml:id="3405" display="no">Miss Sutton</persName> took me to see Aston House, a noble 16</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> century mansion, once the seat of the Holts, now a municipal museum.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Then I called on <persName xml:id="88">Jimmie Adderley</persName>, &amp; talked with him for an hour. He is as distressingly irrelevant as ever: yet his manner of life &amp; the squalid circumstances in which he chooses to live, provide such proofs of sincerity that one must needs honour &amp; respect him.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I went to the Y.M.C.A. Institute, where about 90 clergy were at lunch. They had been convened to listen to an oration from me on "Reunion". I spoke for 35 minutes, &amp; was much applauded.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Then I went to the Station, &amp; took train for Durham, where I arrived safely about 8 p.m.</hi>
