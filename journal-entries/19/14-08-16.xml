<hi>I celebrated in the cathedral at 8 a.m. Very solemn and peaceful. One's thoughts went away to those scenes of carnage &amp; cruelty in Belgium.</hi>

<hi>At Mattins <persName xml:id="2799">Knowling</persName> preached an excellent &amp; timely sermon on 'Religious Courage'.</hi>

<hi rend="bold underline">The service for reception of the regimental colours of the Durham County Militia, raised originally to defend the country against Napoleon, was attended by an immense congregation</hi>, &amp; no less than &#x00A3;94.16.0 was collected. <persName xml:id="3462">Lord Durham</persName> made an excellent little speech, but was not, I fear, well heard as he raised the echoes. The singing was very moving. I preached on <ref xml:id="773">"Symbols"</ref>, taking as my text Joshua XXIV. 26, 27.

<hi>Lord Durham &amp; <persName xml:id="3504">Lady Anne Lambton</persName> came in to tea afterwards, &amp; sundry neighbours.</hi>

<hi>After they had departed, <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I walked up to the Observatory, &amp; feasted our eyes on the view. The Cathedral, seen in the light of the setting sun, was inexpressibly beautiful.</hi>
