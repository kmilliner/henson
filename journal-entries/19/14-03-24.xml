<hi rend="italic">Last night's debate must damage the credit of the Government very seriously. The attempt to coerce the officers into surrendering their scruples, &amp; the rapid backing&#8211;down before their resistance form an exhibition of feebleness immensely discreditable in itself, &amp; bound to draw in its train a long train of mischiefs.</hi><note xml:id="180" n="1"></note> <hi rend="italic bold underline"><persName xml:id="508">Balfour</persName> made a powerful attack on the Ministry, &amp; tore to shreds their explanations of the sudden crisis</hi><hi rend="italic">. It is hard not to suspect that there really has been a shameful conspiracy against the <persName xml:id="215">Prime Minister</persName> within his own cabinet. The speeches of <persName xml:id="2441">Winston Churchill</persName> at Bradford, &amp; <persName xml:id="234">Lloyd&#8211;George</persName> at Huddersfield, coinciding with the truculent utterances of <persName xml:id="3451">Redmond</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2973">Devlin</persName>, and going long with these strange military happenings seem to point to an attempt to force an explosion in Ulster. <persName xml:id="218">Lord Roberts</persName> &amp; the <persName xml:id="128">Abp. of Canterbury</persName> have been visiting the King as well as the Ministers. The effect on the Empire, &amp; on the Continent must be disastrous.</hi></p>
