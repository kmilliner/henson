<hi>I attended a special meeting of the Council of the Durham Colleges. We did the requisite 'war&#8211;business'. After lunch we motored to Whorlton, &amp; had tea with the <persName xml:id="552">Headlams</persName><persName xml:id="553"></persName>. Their house is beautifully situated, and the grounds border the Tees. The stony &amp; irregular channel winding at the foot of a well&#8211;wooded and almost precipitous bank reminds one of Scotland. I was delighted to see a king&#8211;fisher.</hi>

<hi>Headlam has just returned from a visit to Australia &amp; Japan. Travelling by the Siberian Railway he was fortunate enough to get back to England just before the outbreak of war. He gives me no good account of Australia.</hi>

<hi>I attended at the school to see the Emergency Volunteers start their drilling. About 200 turned up, &amp; marched about with admirable pertinacity. Among the patriots I noticed <persName xml:id="2919">Brown</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="2809">Freeman</persName>.</hi>
