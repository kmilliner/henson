I devoted the day to the preparation of an "Inaugural Lecture" on <ref xml:id="736">'History as a guide to Social Reform'</ref>, and delivered the poor result of my labours to a meeting of the <orgName xml:id="229">"Workers' Educational Association"</orgName> in Newcastle. The audience included several clergymen &amp; ladies, but the bulk of it was composed of eminently respectable artisans. They listened with sombre attentiveness, and applauded demurely when I sate down: but the tone of my references to current social efforts was too detached &amp; depressing for them: &amp; they were perhaps a little disappointed. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went with me. We returned to Durham by a slow train stated to arrive at 10.11 p.m. It actually reached Durham at 10.55 p.m.

On the station in Newcastle I bought for sevenpence <ref xml:id="743">"The Autobiography of <persName xml:id="3491">Mark Rutherford</persName>"</ref>, and finished reading it through before going to bed. <hi rend="italic">It is a striking picture of the spiritual penury &amp; mental squalor of English Dissent.</hi>
