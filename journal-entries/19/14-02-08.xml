<hi rend="bold underline">While was dressing a note was brought to me from <persName xml:id="473">Knowling</persName> to say that his <persName xml:id="2802">wife</persName> was dead</hi>. I sent across a few words of sympathy. She was a good &amp; kind woman, who will be sincerely lamented.</p>

The <persName xml:id="590">Archdeacon</persName> preached at Mattins, &amp; tacked on an obituary notice to his sermon including an invitation to pray for the soul of the deceased!</p>

<persName xml:id="2936">Jack Boden</persName> accompanied me to Sunderland in the motor. There I preached at S. Ignatius's Church to a crowded congregation. This church was built by <persName xml:id="1817">Bishop Lightfoot</persName> at his own expense. We got back to Durham in 45 minutes.</p>
