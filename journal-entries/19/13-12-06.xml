         <p><hi>I attended the Chapter Meeting, which was 'bright, brief, &amp;, brotherly'! I stated that after Lent I proposed to resume the proper Decanal method of nominating the preachers in Advent &amp; Lent.</hi>

         <p><persName xml:id="3513">Cummings</persName> drove us to Lumley Castle, &amp; back without disaster. We lunched with <persName xml:id="3465">Lord</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3466">Lady Scarbrough</persName>, <hi rend="underline">her</hi> daughter (<persName xml:id="3515">Miss Ashton</persName>), and <persName xml:id="3516">Lady Eden</persName>. After lunch our hosts shewed us the house. It is really notable. In the hall are four contemporary busts of the Tudor princes, Henry VIII &amp; his 3 children – Edward, Mary, &amp; Elizabeth. The list of pictures at Lumley castle in 1590 includes a wonderful list of art–treasures, which have been scattered &amp; lost. Lady Scarbrough has bestowed much pains &amp; money in decorating &amp; furnishing the Castle: &amp; mainly her expenditure has been determined by good taste.
