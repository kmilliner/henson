         <p>Immediately after breakfast I went to a barber in Prince's Street recommended by mine host &amp; was by him trimmed &amp; shampooed. Then, returning to the house, I joined <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3476" display="no">Miss Gordon</persName>, &amp; went with them to see the Exhibition of Pictures &amp; Sculpture. This was not very impressive. We lunched at home, &amp; then came away to Glasgow.</p>
         <p>On the platform at Glasgow we were joined by <persName xml:id="712">M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Adam Muir</persName>, who, unknown to us, had travelled from Edinburgh by the same train. Ella here left me, hastening to catch her train to Helensburgh. M<hi rend="superscript underline">c</hi>Adam Muir &amp; I went to 1. Atholl Gardens, through a deluge of rain.</p>
         <p>At dinner were <persName xml:id="976">Sir W<hi rend="superscript underline">m</hi> Bilsland</persName>, <persName xml:id="3475">Rait</persName> now Professor of Scottish History, and <persName xml:id="1073" display="no">Milligan</persName>. Also <persName xml:id="3477" display="no">Miss Story</persName>. I had some conversation with Milligan about <persName xml:id="359">Sanday's</persName> Answer to <persName xml:id="49">Gore</persName>. He had read nothing beyond <persName xml:id="2155">Denny's</persName> Review in the <ref xml:id="744" display="no">"British Weekly"</ref>.</p>
