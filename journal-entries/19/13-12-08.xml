<hi>We motored to Stockton&#8211;on&#8211;Tees in order to attend a meeting of the <orgName xml:id="198">Bible Society</orgName>. First there was a reception at the Vicarage, where I shook hands with a number of the local clergy &amp; Nonconformist ministers. Then followed the meeting which was well attended, &amp; presided over by a Quaker with one arm. I was the principal, indeed the only speaker, &amp; I spoke for just 45 minutes. There was close attention, &amp; every appearance of interest &amp; even enthusiasm. We motored back to Durham after the meeting, &amp; got into the Deanery about 10.45 p.m. <persName xml:id="3513">Cummings</persName> drove the car very steadily, &amp; without accident of any kind.</hi></p>
