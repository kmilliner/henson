<hi>The Argyll C<hi rend="superscript underline">y</hi>'s man, Clark, was reported ill, so we raised a youth from <persName xml:id="3514">Laidler</persName>, the Company's agent here, and he accompanied <persName xml:id="3513">Cummings</persName> to Gateshead, whither I had occasion to go in order to read a paper to the clergy on "The Interpretation of Scripture in Sermons". I read to them most part of my lecture on that subject in "The Liberty of Prophesying". There were a few questions asked at the end, but none of any marked intelligence!</hi>
