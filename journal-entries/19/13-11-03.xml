I addressed a small company of ladies in the interest of the <orgName xml:id="15">Settlement in Bethnal Green</orgName>. The meeting was held in the Examination Schools, &amp; presided over by the late Rector of Exeter, <persName xml:id="93">Jackson</persName>. Miss Harrington spoke at excessive length, <hi rend="bold underline">&amp; I distilled platitudes for 20 minutes</hi>. <hi rend="bold underline">I suspect that the badness of the meeting is really due to resentment against me on the score of Female Suffrage.</hi>

I went to London by the 1.54 p.m. express: &amp; drove at once to Westminster, where I had tea with <persName xml:id="636">Pearce</persName>. Then I picked up <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> at the British Museum, &amp; went with her to King's Cross, where we caught the 5.30 p.m. express: &amp; reached Durham about 10.30 p.m.
