<hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="2800">Culley</persName> was reported ill, &amp; I celebrated in his stead at 8 a.m. There were but few communicants, including <persName xml:id="1696">Olive</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1951">Christian</persName>. We had to do without the organ, as Ellis could not be recalled in time. The choir sang without accompaniment very well. <persName xml:id="2025">Lord Guthrie</persName> &amp; his wife were in church: they communicated (being Presbyterians) at the midday Celebration.
