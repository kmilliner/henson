         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m. in the Cathedral. There were, perhaps as many as 75 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>. At 10 a.m. we read Mattins: and then followed the Choral Eucharist, at which <hi rend="bold underline">I preached a political sermon, dwelling on the imminent risk of Civil War in Ireland, &amp; appealing for a more intelligent public opinion.</hi> There was but a small congregation. I had, however, taken the precaution of sending a fairly copious extract of my discourse to the "Times". I attended Evensong at 4 p.m. The singing was very good. <persName xml:id="3241">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Cavendish</persName> &amp; his <persName xml:id="3242">wife</persName> came to tea afterwards.
