<hi>The <persName xml:id="648">Car&#x00F6;es</persName><persName xml:id="2127"></persName> went off after breakfast.</hi></p>
         <p>
<p>At luncheon were our Swedish Teacher, Osborne, <persName xml:id="3383">Fairbairn</persName>, &amp; a young lady whom <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> evolved from nowhere!</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">Fairbairn came to consult me about taking Orders in the Church of England. He is bred a Presbyterian of the straiter sect, but leans to Anglicanism: but he has been comparatively well educated at Edinburgh &amp; Manchester, &amp; is accustomed to think as well as read. Recent events have made him fearful of what might befall him presently, if he were ordained in a church which numbers <persName xml:id="49">Gore</persName>, <persName xml:id="105">Talbot</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="166">Ingram</persName> among its leaders. I could say but little to comfort him.</hi></p>
