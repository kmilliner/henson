         <p>
I returned to the Deanery by an early train, &amp; was met at the station by <persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="41">Harry Davis</persName>. The last had arrived with his <persName xml:id="2862">wife</persName> during my absence yesterday. I spent the residue of the morning in writing letters, &amp; paying bills.
         </p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="2806">Bailey</persName> came in to lunch, &amp; displayed much recondite knowledge in talking with Davis, the 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> volume of whose book on Norman Charters has just appeared.
         </p>
         <p>
I attended Evensong in the Cathedral, &amp; then went through the papers of 23 gentlemen, who are candidates for the vacant history lectureship;<hi rend="italic">and with Davis's assistance, selected seven names</hi>.
