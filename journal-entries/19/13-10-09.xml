<persName xml:id="41">Harry Davis</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2862">his wife</persName> took their departure for Oxford by the early train. Then I finished my sermon for Newcastle.

After lunch I attended the functions connected with the opening of the <orgName xml:id="266">Blue Coat School</orgName>. There was a service in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Nicholas Church, at which the <persName xml:id="276">Bishop of Durham</persName> preached. Then we went in procession to the school, where I presided at the formal opening by <persName xml:id="2817">Lady Londonderry</persName>.

<hi rend="italic bold underline"><persName xml:id="555">Bishop Tucker</persName> is much excited about the article in the "Church Times" headed "Jerry building</hi><hi rend="italic">", in which the action of the <persName xml:id="3443">Bishop of Monbasa</persName> [sic] in celebrating the Holy Communion in a Presbyterian Church, though with the Anglican service, is much denounced.</hi>

<persName xml:id="648">Car&#x00F6;e</persName> arrived in time for (a slightly delayed) dinner. He gave me a vivacious account of the conflict within the committee of architectural experts at S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Paul's.
