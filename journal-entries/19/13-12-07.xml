         <p>
A dark morning &amp; bitterly cold. It is 13 years since on the 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> Sunday in Advent I first preached as Rector of <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>, Westminster.</p>
         <p>
I celebrated in the Cathedral at 8 a.m. There were a good many communicants in spite of the cold &amp; gloom. </p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="555">Bishop Tucker</persName> preached at Mattins rather more connectedly than heretofore.</p>
         <p>
I preached at Evensong on old sermon. It was the 8<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> time of delivery! The subject "Times of Spiritual Distress"; the text 1. Samuel iii. 1. There was by no means a large congregation. Evidently the folk of Durham are by no means eager to hear the Dean!</p>
         <p>
Later I went to the little church on the Bailey, &amp; preached to the students of S. John's Hall, who are accustomed to use it as their chapel.</p>
         <p>
In the course of the day I wrote letters to <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1204">Mary</persName>.</p>
