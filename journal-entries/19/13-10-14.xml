<persName xml:id="3447" display="no">Miss Ramsay</persName> left after breakfast. I finished the Oxford sermon.

<hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="132">Liddell</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3206">Victor Williamson</persName> came to lunch. The latter grows frail. He was <persName xml:id="505">Dean Stanley's</persName> literary executor, and knew him intimately. He has a story of Stanley bringing <persName xml:id="495">Carlyle</persName> to hear <persName xml:id="187">Farrar</persName> preach in the Abbey Church. The Sage was greatly perturbed by the Canon's rhetoric, &amp; indicated the fact by banging his stick on the floor, a performance which recalled to Stanley's mind the well&#8211;known incident when <persName xml:id="3452">Dean Williams</persName> shewed his displeasure at <persName xml:id="3453">Heylyn's</persName> sermon against the Puritans by similar demonstrations in the 'great Pew'.</hi>

The <persName xml:id="2613">Dean of Ely</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3454">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Kirkpatrick</persName> were in the Cathedral at Evensong, &amp; afterwards came in to see us. We made them come to dinner. He &amp; I had some talk about cathedral management. Ely has <hi rend="underline">no</hi> fabric fund, &amp; a total revenue of no more than &#x00A3;<hi rend="doubleunderline">12,500</hi>.
