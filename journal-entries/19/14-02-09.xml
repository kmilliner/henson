<hi>I completed the notes for my lecture on "</hi><hi rend="bold underline">Witchcraft</hi><hi> in England". Then I went to see poor <persName xml:id="473">Knowling</persName>, in order to arrange for the funeral service. I attended service in the Cathedral, &amp; then went with <persName xml:id="2936">Boden</persName> to Newcastle, and delivered the Lecture in the Theatre of the Literary &amp; Philosophical Institute. There was a crowded attendance, &amp; very close attention. I spoke for 65 minutes in an atmosphere which became almost asphyxiating. After the function was over we returned to Durham.</hi>
