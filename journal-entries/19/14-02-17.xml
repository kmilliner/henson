<hi>I took the chair at <persName xml:id="112">Ella's</persName> Meeting for the Zenana Mission, slipping away during its progress to go off to York for the <orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName>. I travelled with a gentleman, who started immediately to discuss Kikuyu, and finally introduced himself as Lieut. Colonel Challoner, a member of the Northern House of Laymen. At Darlington we changed trains. In the carriage was the <persName xml:id="3129">Duke of Northumberland</persName>, with whom I travelled out in the Archiepiscopal motor to Bishopthorpe.</hi>
