         <p>I attended Mattins in the Cathedral: afterwards <persName xml:id="3526" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Gaymer</persName> came to announce his intention of beginning work forthwith. I visited the improvised Reading Room, and there found <persName xml:id="3525">Colonel Doyle</persName> &amp; another officer, whom I forthwith shewed over the Cathedral. Then I walked to the Race Ground to see the horses which have been collected by the military. There are about 500, mostly good&#8211;looking beasts. After lunch I wrote a short sermon for the soldier's service, &amp; then went out again for news.

         <p>The accounts of the German attack on Li&#x00E9;ge disclose in the Belgian an unexpected valour. They have "held up" the invaders for several priceless days, and inflicted immense losses.
