<hi>The Deanery here is the old episcopal palace, which was applied to its present use about the year 1860. It is a great medieval house with Georgian additions. The drawing room &#8211; 55 feet long &#8211; is a noble apartment; and the vaulted chamber underneath is scarcely inferior. There is a charming chapel with Jacobean screen, panelling, &amp; benching. The view from the windows over the Severn is magnificent.</hi>

<hi>I was housed in 'the King's room', a lofty panelled room so designated from George III who occupied it. The <persName xml:id="1814">Dean</persName> tells me that the actual value of the Deanery is about &#x00A3;1700 per annum.</hi>

<hi>There was a dinner party. The <persName xml:id="2047">Bishop of Worcester</persName> &amp; his daughter were among the guests. </hi>
