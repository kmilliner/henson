<hi><persName xml:id="228">The Warden's</persName> death adds more than ordinary sadness to this time, which for me is always sad since then I must needs recall my Ordination, &amp; face the failure of the Ministry which that event began. Twenty seven years have passed, and they leave me with an ever waxing burden of memories that humiliate, and doubts that enfeeble.</hi> <hi rend="italic bold underline">This is the first occasion on which I have been asked to preach an Ordination Sermon, and now I am asked rather out of deference to my office than out of regard for my person</hi><hi rend="i bold">!</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I celebrated at 8 a.m. At 10 a.m. the Ordination took place. My sermon was delivered from the pulpit, not from the Altar&#8211;rail. The whole service took nearly 3 hours. Afterwards, I gave the 22 candidates severally a copy of <ref xml:id="87">"Notes of my Ministry"</ref>.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>After Evensong the candidates &amp; their friends came in to the Deanery: &amp; had tea. Also I showed them the Library. Then <persName xml:id="1255">Linetta</persName> &amp; I walked to the top of "Nine Tree Hill"; cheered by a brilliant rain&#8211;bow in the ascent, &amp; rewarded for the exertion by a glorious view of the English Sion.</hi>

<hi><persName xml:id="2920">Gee</persName> preached a good sermon at Evensong.</hi>
