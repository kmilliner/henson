<hi>The 'Great Chapter' concerned itself almost altogether with the Fabric. <persName xml:id="648">Car&#x00F6;e</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3444">Macartney</persName> were both present. We went carefully through the recommendations on which they had come to an agreement, and adopted them. <persName xml:id="3526" display="no">Gaymer</persName>, Car&#x00F6;e's contractor, attended, &amp; was commissioned to undertake the work. In answer to my question, he said that we should probably have to expend &#x00A3;20,000: and that the work would probably take five years.</hi>

<hi>After the meeting both the Architects lunched with us.</hi>

         <p>
<hi>We motored Car&#x00F6;e &amp; <persName xml:id="2127">his wife</persName> to see Pittington and Finchale priory. The last is in a very ruinous condition. We actually lighted on a party of boys in the act of kicking down stones from the crumbling walls! We had tea at the farmhouse: and I had some talk about the care of the ruins with the old farmer, who is nominally in charge of them.</hi>

<persName xml:id="3484">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Gee</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3174">Miss Wragge</persName> came in to dinner. The last is a vehement suffragist. That madness breaks out everywhere.
