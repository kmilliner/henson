I did make a start on the Oxford sermon. For text I chose the passages S. Luke xvii.20, 21 &amp; Romans xii.16. My thesis will be a protest against indulging in windy theories of so&#8211;called altruism, &amp; disregarding the near &amp; known duties of our place &amp; station. Progress was slow, &amp; at the end of the day I had written only 15 pages.

I walked <persName xml:id="1266">Moore</persName> to Observatory Hill, &amp; made him rhapsodize over the view. We attended Evensong in the Cathedral, &amp; afterwards looked at the church.

<persName xml:id="3447" display="no">Miss Susie Ramsay</persName> arrived here. <persName xml:id="2800">Culley</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3448">his wife</persName>, also <persName xml:id="2798">Dolphin</persName>, came in after dinner, &amp; we had some music. They all, including <persName xml:id="2894">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Moore</persName>, agree in saying that the piano is not worth our keeping.

<hi rend="italic bold underline"><persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName> sent me his sermon on "Home Rule" which he preached in the Cathedral last month</hi><hi rend="italic">. He doesn't apparently see that such sermons may provoke counter&#8211;sermons &#8211; "they that take the sword shall perish with the sword" &#8211; &amp; thus by a process both natural &amp; rapid the pulpit must descend to the level of the party&#8211;political platform. He mistakes the strength of his feelings for an assurance of superior discernment, &amp; silently consecrates the error until it seems to be a religious duty to speak his mind!</hi>
