<hi rend="italic">On Thursday, May 2</hi><hi rend="i sup u">nd</hi><hi rend="italic">, the Chapter was held. The morning's paper announced the appointment of the <persName xml:id="2785">Bishop of Sheffield</persName> to the canonry vacated by the <persName xml:id="2533">Bishop of Jarrow's</persName> acceptance of the Bishoprick of Bristol. Thus my attempt to get <persName xml:id="216">Gow</persName> appointed is defeated, &amp; I am disconcerted &amp; humiliated. The whole proceeding is hard to understand. <persName xml:id="128">Lang</persName> has shuffled off on to Durham the Bishop who had been left on his hands by the creation of the see of Sheffield. <persName xml:id="276">Moule</persName> has succeeded in renewing the corrupt arrangement by which he saves himself the cost of a suffragan by appropriating one of the Durham canonries. The salient outstanding fact is that the appointment has been made without any reference to the needs of the Foundation, &amp; without any opportunity being given to me to state them.</hi>
