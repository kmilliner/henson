<hi>The weather has become warm &amp; fine. I went with <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; the two Canadians to see the blue&#8211;bells (or rather blue hyacinths) on the wood to which <persName xml:id="2662">Cruickshank</persName> introduced me yesterday. The loveliness of the flower&#8211;carpet on which the sun&#8211;light danced, &amp; from which the trees rose like spell&#8211;bound giants was wonderful.</hi>

<hi>A large number of German Pastors, who are holding a conference in Sunderland, came to Evensong in the Cathedral, &amp; afterwards to Tea in the Deanery. I shewed them over the Church. They were the rougher type of pastor for the most part, engaged in ministering to German sailors in the sea&#8211;ports. The party included a sprinkling of Swedes.</hi>
