<hi>I celebrated at 8 a.m. and forgot (until reminded by <persName xml:id="2692">Budworth</persName>) to minister the chalice to the clergy within the rails. This stupidity of mine caused a regrettable dislocation of the devotional order.</hi>

<hi rend="bold underline">At Matins I installed <persName xml:id="2785">Bishop Quirk</persName> as canon</hi>. There was a quaint ceremony in the Chapter House first. I gave him a copy of the statutes together with a loaf of bread &amp; a bottle of wine, saying: &#8211; "We receive thee as a Canon &amp; invest thee &amp; deliver to thee the form of regular observance contained in this book for thy spiritual food &amp; the corporal refreshment of bread &amp; wine as a support of thy labours."

<hi>The same day, I went with the Receiver to visit the Chapter Estates. We devoted all our time to the village of Great Burdon, of which we are sole owners. We visited five tenants.</hi>

<hi>On our return, we read in the evening paper that Austria had declared war on Servia. </hi>
