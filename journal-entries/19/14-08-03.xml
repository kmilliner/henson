A melancholy wet day, matching the dolourous excitements of the time. The morning papers added nothing to our information, but <hi rend="bold underline">in the afternoon came news that the Germans had violated Belgian territory in defiance of treaties, &amp; in the teeth of a formal refusal of permission</hi>.

It appears to be the case that Italy will stand out of the quarrel, holding the war to be 'essentially offensive'. This is the only item of news which can be regarded as satisfactory.

He has made some considerable benefactions to Glasgow, &amp; is noted for his vehement advocacy of total abstinence.
