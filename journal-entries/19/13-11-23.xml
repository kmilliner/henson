         <p>I attended morning service in the Cathedral. <persName xml:id="376">Knox Little</persName> preached as Canon in Residence. His sermon was disfigured by gibes at the new Criticism etc., but otherwise was not displeasing. After service I walked along the Bank of the Severn.
         </p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">At 3 p.m. I addressed a considerable company of men on "History as a guide to Social Progress"</hi>. There were some questions asked at the close, but none of any special interest.
         </p>
         <p>At 6.30 p.m. I preached in the Cathedral from I Samuel iii.1, "The word of the <hi rend="underline">Lord</hi> was precious in those days: there was no open vision". The congregation was very large &amp; very attentive. <persName xml:id="433">Canons Wilson</persName> and <persName xml:id="1582">Claughton</persName> were present as well as the <persName xml:id="1814">Dean</persName>.
         </p>
         <p>After service the Dean showed me the most interesting Norman crypt of Bishop Wulfstan. It can have no rival in the country.
