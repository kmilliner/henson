In the afternoon I went to Newcastle, &amp; there dined at the Mansion House with the Lord Mayor. We all went to a meeting in the interest of the <orgName xml:id="175"><hi rend="bold underline">National Service League</hi></orgName>. The Lord Mayor presided. <persName xml:id="2474">Lord Lovat</persName> moved, &amp; I seconded the principal resolution. There was a large &amp; mainly sympathetic audience.
