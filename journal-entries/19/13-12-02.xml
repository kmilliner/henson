         <p><hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="555">Bishop Tucker</persName> brought me a type&#8211;written copy of <persName xml:id="2174">Bishop Willis's</persName> apologia, which I read through, &amp; found admirable. He also shewed me a copy of the <persName xml:id="3469">Bishop of Zanzibar's</persName> <ref xml:id="760" display="no">"Open Letter"</ref>, which is nothing but a vehement protest against the character &amp; action of the Church of England as a reformed church. The Bishop accuses his brother of heresy, &amp; clamours for his trial by the Archbishop on that count!</hi></p>
         <p>I attended Evensong in the Cathedral.</p>
         <p>In the evening I gave a lecture with magic lantern slides on the "Yellowstone Park" to the boys of the School. They kept very still: &amp; <persName xml:id="2692">Budworth</persName> assured me afterwards that they weren't bored!</p>
