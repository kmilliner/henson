I breakfasted early, &amp; then went to Newcastle by a train which arrived nearly 25 minutes after time. <persName xml:id="3449">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> East</persName>, the parson of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Ann's, was on the platform, &amp; steered me to the Church, a rather depressing fabric which dated from the later 18<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century. The <persName xml:id="3442">Lord Mayor</persName> (or rather his deputy, for the L.M. himself is a Papist) and the corporation attended in state &#8211; about 50 altogether. I preached on the Religious View of Civic Government, taking as my text the two passages, Proverbs viii.15, 16 &amp; S. Mk. xxxii.22. Save for the coughing of the industrial school boys, I had no cause to complain of inattention. After service I motored back to the Deanery, &amp; arrived in time for lunch.
