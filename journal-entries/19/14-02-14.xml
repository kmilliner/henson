<hi>I travelled to Birmingham by the train which left Durham at 12.26, and arrived at 5.35 p.m. At the station <persName xml:id="2045">Lord Norton's</persName> valet met me with a request that I would join him &amp; <persName xml:id="88">Jimmie</persName> at the Queen's Hotel for tea. I stayed with them for a few minutes, &amp; then went to Aston Rectory. We encountered <persName xml:id="3404">Canon Sutton</persName> almost at his own gate.</hi>

         <p>"A rather dreary missionary at a <orgName xml:id="124">C.M.S.</orgName> meeting had described how he had been entertained by a Maori Chief. There was a large pie, of which he was pressed to partake, &amp; when the crust was cut open, there emerged a <hi rend="underline">finger</hi>. 'I bet 'twas our parson's,' interrupted a farmer, 'for he'll have his finger in everybody's pie!'"
