         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">The <ref xml:id="650" display="no">"Times"</ref> contained a very fair report of my speech at the <orgName xml:id="183">Literary Fund</orgName> Dinner last night.</hi></p>
         <p>
I called for <persName xml:id="1095">Aubrey</persName> at 10 a.m. &amp; went with him to the zoo, where we spent 3 hours very pleasantly. Then we lunched together at the Criterion. We walked back to the Hotel Windsor.</p>
         <p>
Later in the day I returned to Durham, while <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> betook herself to <persName xml:id="882" display="no">Mrs Webbe</persName>. My journey was uneventful save that at Grantham a clergyman got into my compartment &amp; <hi rend="bold underline">introduced himself to me as the son of <persName xml:id="2840" display="no">Austin Dobson</persName>, the poet</hi>. He said that he remembered meeting me at Bonskeid in 1890; that he had postponed his own ordination on account of intellectual difficulties: &amp; that now he was a curate at Benwell near Newcastle. I reached Durham about 11.45 p.m., &amp; was clamourously welcomed by Logic.</p>
