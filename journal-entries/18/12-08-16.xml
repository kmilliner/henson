The main battle of a Christian is not in the open field, his quarrels are most within, and his enemies are in his own breast, when he hath reformed an ill life, yet it shall cost him infinitely much more to reform an ill heart; he may receive so much power from grace at the beginning, as in a short time, to draw off from most of the former gross acts of sinnings, but it will be a work of all his days to get a thorough conquest of secret corruptions.</p>

I received a kind letter from the <persName xml:id="325">Dean</persName>. <hi rend="bold underline">The morning I devoted to composing a reply to the Solicitors of the <persName xml:id="2702">Putumayo Directors</persName><persName xml:id="2705"></persName><persName xml:id="2706" display="no"></persName>. It was of the most uncompromising character, so that if they seriously meditate legal proceedings, they will not lack the requisite encouragement from me.</hi></p>

In the afternoon I had my hair cut; looked in at the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName> &amp; saw <persName xml:id="322">Buckle</persName> who is about to leave for South Africa; then with <persName xml:id="77">Marion's</persName> assistance packed away letters &amp;c preparatory to departure.</p>
