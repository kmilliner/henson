We travelled to Birchington by the 10.40 a.m. train from Holborn, arriving at 12.38 noon. We lunched with <persName xml:id="77">Marion</persName>, <persName xml:id="1095">Aubrey</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2672">Lois</persName> and then Aubrey &amp; I walked on the cliffs. We had tea in her room with <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName>, &amp; then returned to London.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">Carissima is indisposed with a bronchitical attack, hostile to sleep, &amp; therefore infinitely wearying. But she had been to Church on Sunday last, and greatly to the delight of her holy &amp; loving spirit, had received the Holy Communion with Aubrey &amp; Lois.</hi></p>
