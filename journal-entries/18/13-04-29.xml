I attended service in the chapel, &amp; thought much of the former times, 29 years ago, when first I used to do so. Should I not have been a happier man, &amp; more useful, if I had stayed on in Oxford?</p>
         <p>
I walked to Christ Church, &amp; called on <persName xml:id="250">Watson</persName>, with whom I had some talk.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">Then I walked to 11 Fryfield Road, &amp; lunched with <persName xml:id="41">Harry Davis</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2862">his wife</persName>. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">We went together to the Sheldonian to vote on the Divinity Degrees statutes. The crowd was so great that we could not gain admission. There had been a mighty gathering of Obscurantists from every Temple of Bigotry in the country. The statutes were thrown out by great majorities.</hi></p>
         <p>
After sending telegrams to <persName xml:id="590">Watkins</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="555">Tucker</persName>, I walked to Magdalen, &amp; had tea with <persName xml:id="2128">Olaf Car√∂e</persName>. We walked together round Magdalen Walks twice, &amp; got under cover only just in time to escape a violent thunderstorm.
