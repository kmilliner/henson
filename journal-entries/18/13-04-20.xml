Bright sun, &amp; a bitterly cold wind. I celebrated in the Cathedral at 8 a.m. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; our guests <persName xml:id="3181">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi></persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3182">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Prideaux</persName>, communicated. Litany &amp; Holy Communion took exactly 45 minutes.</p>
         <p>
At Mattins happened an untoward circumstance &#8211; <hi rend="bold underline">the <orgName xml:id="276">Bede College</orgName> students left the church in a body during the Hymn after Mattins</hi><hi rend="bold">!</hi> Presumably they would not be present at any part of the Communion Service! These Northerners have odd notions of discipline. I read the Lessons, and <persName xml:id="555">Bp. Tucker</persName> preached &amp; celebrated. There were but 5 women to communicate apart from the clergy.         </p>
         <p>
I attended Evensong in the Cathedral: &amp; then was fetched in a motor&#8211;car, &amp; conveyed to Sunderland, where I preached in S. Mark's Church – a sufficiently modest building erected 41 years ago to serve a district cut out of the old parish of MonkWearmouth [sic]. The parson – <persName xml:id="3180">Newman</persName> – seemed a reasonable person. The R.V. was used at the Lectern. The congregation was rather markedly <hi rend="underline">feminine</hi>, but attentive: &amp; the service hearty. I returned to Durham by the 9.40 train.</p>
