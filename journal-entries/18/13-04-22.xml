<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I breakfasted early, &amp; bade farewell to our guests. We travelled to Newcastle by the 8.45 a.m. train in order to attend a breakfast, organized by the <persName xml:id="3163">Hon. Emily Kinnaird</persName> in order to start a scheme for a <orgName xml:id="237">Young Women's Christian Association Institute</orgName>. An aged Wesleyan – <persName xml:id="3166">Sir W<hi rend="superscript underline">m</hi> Stephenson</persName> – presided. He was referred by the <persName xml:id="3164" display="no">Lord Mayor</persName> as the leading citizen in Newcastle. I made a brief speech, &amp; rashly promised &#x00A3;<hi rend="doubleunderline">30</hi> in three annual payments. Then we went into the City: I got my hair cut: &amp; we bought some furniture at Robson's. Then we went to lunch with the workers, &amp; I spoke to them again. Then we parted, Ella going to call on <persName xml:id="3165">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Straton</persName>, &amp; I returned to Durham, &amp; attended Evensong in the Cathedral.</p>
         <p>
After dinner the Committee of Chapter appointed to prepare plans &amp; estimates for the new House met in my Study. <persName xml:id="2694">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Wood</persName>, the Architect, produced his plans, &amp; <persName xml:id="2692">Budworth</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName> – as educational experts – made criticisms &amp; suggestions. We were all rather dismayed at the cost – &#x00A3;6500 apart from architect's fees. </p>
