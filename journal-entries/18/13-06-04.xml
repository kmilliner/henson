I walked to Westminster after breakfast, &amp; made inquiries for reports &amp;c on Durham Cathedral, but with little success. Then I went to the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName>, 
<hi rend="bold underline">&amp; wrote a sharp little letter to the 'Nation'</hi> &#8211; so sharp that they will not probably publish it. I returned to S. Paul's in time to join a luncheon party, which included <persName xml:id="122">Hine Haycock</persName>, <persName xml:id="1255">Linetta</persName>, <persName xml:id="2698" display="no">Miss Ward</persName>, <persName xml:id="2697">Miss Barlow</persName>, &amp; others. After lunch <persName xml:id="1261">Violet Markham's</persName> car took us out. We left cards on divers people, &amp; then had tea on the Terrace with the Lough's. Several members of my acquaintance had speech with me.

We walked back to the Deanery stopping on the way to call on the <persName xml:id="966">Master of the Temple</persName>. His brother&#8211;in&#8211;law, <persName xml:id="2707">Birchenough</persName>, came in while we were there. We all (<persName xml:id="427">Ralph</persName>, <persName xml:id="1209">Kittie</persName>, <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I) dined with <persName xml:id="2681" display="no">Lady Emmott</persName>. I took in <persName xml:id="2699">Lady Ward</persName>, the wife of the late Premier of New Zealand. It was on the whole a pleasant party. <persName xml:id="2682">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Peel</persName>, the newly married daughter was there, but not <persName xml:id="2683">her husband</persName>, who pleaded indisposition.</p>
