         <p>At last we are back in England &#8211; in the old land for the new life. What is to come of it? God only knows. For my part, more than ever, I feel as a straw on the stream, or a feather in the wind &#8211; a powerless creature carried along by a vast power to goals I cannot discern. There is the strain &amp; shock of parting from Westminster to be faced &#8211; the reproaches, unuttered but none the less severe &#8211; of friends who cannot know how &amp; why I could have consented to leave them. I must turn my back for ever on the scenes of effort: close, &amp; hand in, the record of work: lay down finally the instruments of my warfare. It is all very dreadful, &amp; my heart dies down within me. <hi rend="bold underline">Am I right in going to Durham? Assuredly I did not seek to go: nor did I look to go. Had I been able to choose, I sh</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">d</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> not have chosen this moment, or that place. Yet I said, Yes, without hesitation when the summons came. It is too late to consider duty now. I have made my choice, &amp; must go forward. "Show Thou me the way that I sh</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">d</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> walk in, for I lift up my soul unto Thee"</hi>.</p>
