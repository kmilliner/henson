<hi rend="bold">Tuesday, October 29</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1912. Philadelphia.</hi></p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">While we were dressing, a cable arrived from <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName>, saying that a <persName xml:id="2764">girl</persName> had been born</hi>, &amp; that both <persName xml:id="2056">mother</persName> &amp; child were progressing favourably. Also the Treasurer of Bryn Mawr sent me my 'honorarium' of fifty dollars.</p>

The morning papers report more sensational victories of the Balkan powers.<note xml:id="200" n="1"></note> It looks as if we shall soon hear of the total collapse of the Ottoman power, &amp; the capture of Constantinople. How Freeman would have rejoiced to see that day! The military wiseacres who have persistently prophesised the victory of the Turks have a sufficiently foolish aspect. Meanwhile the really grave question comes threateningly nearer, what will the settlement be? Can the Christianisation of the Balkans be accomplished without a collision between Austria &amp; Russia? Can such a collision be limited to those powers? Is not the stage being prepared for the great tragedy of Harmageddon?</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">Before going out I wrote to Harold in his new character of the happy Father.</hi></p>

After breakfast we went by trolley to the Zoological gardens, &amp; there spent the morning very agreeably. The bears, vultures &amp; eagles, deer, &amp; smaller mammals were all unusually good. Returning to the Hotel we found out the palatial office of the Girard Trust C<hi rend="superscript underline">y</hi>, and cashed the aforesaid 'honorarium'.</p>

<hi rend="italic bold underline">On our arrival in the Hotel a telegram from <persName xml:id="1266">Professor Edward Moore</persName> was handed to me</hi><hi rend="italic">. It ran thus:&#8211;</hi></p>
<div type="letter">
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">Following cable received from <persName xml:id="215">Asquith</persName> London with the King's approval offer you Deanery of Durham in view of your cable to <persName xml:id="325">Ryle</persName> shall announce appointment forthwith.</hi></p>
</div>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">To this I send a reply in a cable to the prime Minister expressed thus:&#8211;</hi></p>
<div type="letter">
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">Thanks for the offer of Deanery received today.</hi></p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">Am writing formal acceptance.</hi></p>
</div>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic bold underline">So the die is cast: &amp; I shake off the dust of West</hi><hi rend="i bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline"> to immerse myself in the grimier coal dust of Durham.</hi></p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">We walked out in the city after lunch, but were too late to see Independence Hall. So we had our shoes cleaned by a quaint little Italian boy, who said he was 11 years old, &amp; looked even younger, &amp; returned to the Hotel. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">After tea I wrote to the Prime Minister, &amp; to the Dean, in both cases indicating my desire to preach in S</hi><hi rend="i sup u">t</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline"> Margaret's through Advent</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">After dinner I wrote to both the Churchwardens explaining how the suddenness of everything had made it impossible for me to consult them before taking my decision. I wrote also to <persName xml:id="77">Mother</persName>, &amp; to <persName xml:id="636">Pearce</persName>. Also I wrote to tell </hi><persName xml:id="389"><hi rend="italic">M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">r</hi><hi rend="italic"> Bryce</hi></persName><hi rend="italic">.</hi><note xml:id="255" n="2"></note></p>
