A glorious day. The rooks delirious with domestic fervours. I attended Mattins in the Cathedral, and then spent the rest of the morning in shewing <persName xml:id="1261">Violet</persName> over the Church and Castle. Both are amazingly impressive. </p>
         <p>
In the afternoon we attended the sports at the Grammar School, &amp; <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> gave away the prizes. Then we went for a motor&#8211;drive in Violet's car through a country <hi rend="underline">ravaged</hi> by collieries.</p>

There is a sleepiness in the air of Durham which is not favourable to alertness of mind or activity of body. An elderly parson told me that when he came to the city 26 years ago, the first effect of the air was to induce abnormal sleepiness, the next chronic sleeplessness! This is an ill&#8211;omened statement!</p>
