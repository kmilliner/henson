Catholics say that human nature was created good by the good Divine Creator: but that, since it has been diseased by sin, it needs the physician Christ.</p>

A beautiful summer day. I celebrated in the Cathedral at 8 a.m. At Mattins, <persName xml:id="473">Knowling</persName> preached an excellent sermon from the words: "Jesus is Lord".</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="2360">Captain</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3023" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Soltau&#8211;Symons</persName> came to lunch.</p>
         <p>
At 3.30 p.m. the <orgName xml:id="233">Northern Cyclists Association</orgName> attended Evensong in the cathedral: there was a large muster but not so large as had been expected. The Mayor &amp; Corporation also attended. I preached from the words: "<hi rend="underline">He endured as seeing Him who is invisible</hi>".</p>
         <p>
After service I had tea with <persName xml:id="1207" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Simey</persName>, &amp; saw the charming garden attached to the House.</p>
         <p>
Then I went round the cathedral with <persName xml:id="541">Alington</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="777">his wife</persName>.</p>

The week ending on Saturday August 9<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> was without any special interest. <hi rend="bold underline">The Alingtons left on Monday</hi>, and on Wednesday there arrived <persName xml:id="2659">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Smith</persName> (<persName xml:id="1696">Olive</persName>'s Mother) and <persName xml:id="802">Lancelot Troutbeck</persName>. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I went across to lunch with the <persName xml:id="2837">Pembertons</persName><persName xml:id="2843"></persName>, &amp; spent the afternoon pleasantly with them. M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Smith promptly took herself to bed complaining of pains: <persName xml:id="3099">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Stuart</persName> was sent for: and the House disturbed by the distractions of a sick room. This was the more inconvenient as Holidays began to take effect on the household. Caroline went away on Thursday. I finished &amp; sent to the <persName xml:id="105">Bp. Of Winchester</persName>, the paper on 'Divorce' which I rashly undertook to read to the Church Congress. <hi rend="italic bold underline">Also I finished a sermon on <ref xml:id="719">"Peace"</ref> for the Embassy Church at the Hague.</hi></p>
         <p>
On Saturday, Ella &amp; I motored to Ryton; &amp; there I addressed a meeting of 'Brotherhoods' in the open air. The evening was still: there was a good attendance of men: I spoke for 35 minutes, &amp; was well listened to. <hi rend="italic">The Vicar &#8211; <persName xml:id="3022">Randell</persName> &#8211; has a voice like the discharge of cannon! </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">He told me that he had read to his congregation the report in the 'Guardian' of my 'Putumayo' sermon</hi><hi rend="italic">, &amp; that a collection had been made in the parish for the Roman Catholic Mission.</hi></p>
