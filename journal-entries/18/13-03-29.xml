After the rain of yesterday, the sunshine was most welcome. I received a long letter from <persName xml:id="1864"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Balfour Wilson</hi></persName>. Feeling rather exhausted, I strolled about in the garden watching the rooks, &amp;, perhaps, contracting a slight chill, which sent me to bed at an early hour, &amp; with a <hi rend="underline">dismantling</hi> headache &#8211; which was the more annoying as <persName xml:id="1261"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Violet Markham</hi></persName> had arrived for a brief visit. However, I walked her round the banks, and took her to Evensong in the Cathedral first.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I lunched with <persName xml:id="2806">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi></persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2805">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Bayley</persName>. M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Bayley himself guided us to his house â€“ an enlarged cottage pleasantly set on a hill, from which as he descends into Durham he feasts his eyes daily with a noble prospect of the Cathedral.</p>
