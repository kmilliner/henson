Sunday on board ship is a disappointing day. It has lost its normal character of a day of rest, for that is the character of every day. The problem is to kill time, not to find it. Thus it is wholly a day of worship, &amp; the conditions prohibit all the ordinary mechanism of worship. There are no churches and no choirs: &amp; how can the modern man worship without these? Clergy there generally are: but they are not at their best on board ship. The silly chatter of every day has stripped them of professional sanctity: they have betrayed the whole secret of their incompetence in the compulsory intimacies of the deck: they essay an extemporaneous discourse amid unaccustomed &amp; undignified surroundings, &amp; provide materials for merry&#8211;making for the remainder of the holy day! Yet, it might be thought that the isolation of the ocean, &amp; the strangeness of the whole situation, would have been favourable to devotion. When is the world so far away, and God so near, as on board ship in mid&#8211;ocean? In point of fact one is at one's lowest &amp; pettiest on an American liner; though the illimitable sea stretches to the sky&#8211;line on every hand; &amp; there is but an inch or two of metal, &amp; some planks between one's self &amp; death! The immediately contiguous circumstances cloud out of mind the sombre continuing conditions of life at sea.</p>

<hi>There was service in the dining room read very well by the ship's doctor. Afterwards I sate on deck, &amp; wrote letters. We sighted two steamers during the day.</hi></p>

<hi rend="italic">The captain asserts that one </hi><hi rend="italic underline">advantage</hi><hi rend="italic">, which the German liners have over the English is </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">their frank disregard of Sunday</hi><hi rend="italic">. There is no service, &amp; no embargo on games. Some relaxation of Sabbatarianism is taking place on the English boats. Games are now permitted on Sunday afternoons. We had a discussion as to the position &amp; value of the Chaplain on board a man&#8211;of&#8211;war. The naval man at our table &#8211; a pleasant &amp; intelligent man &#8211; returning from the East, maintains that the Chaplain hasn't enough to do: that his position is somewhat ambiguous: that compulsory attendance at divine service is a mistake, &amp; creates a prejudice against it in the men's minds.</hi></p>

I read through a foolish story by <persName xml:id="1287">Maurice Hewlett</persName> called <ref xml:id="709">"Richard Yea &amp; Nea"</ref> &#8211; a fantastical grotesque of an historical romance.</p>
         <p>
I also read thro' a story of <persName xml:id="3188">Gibert Parker</persName>, <ref xml:id="710">'The Right of Way'</ref>.</p>
