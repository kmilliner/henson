There was a sharp fall of snow during the afternoon. I attended the quarterly meeting of the <orgName xml:id="227">Sherburn Hospital Trustees</orgName>, &amp; moved two resolutions designed to terminate the dead&#8211;lock, in which the heated correspondence between the Governors &amp; the Charity Commissioners has worked out. <persName xml:id="590"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Watkins</hi></persName> was in the chair, &amp; went against me. So did <persName xml:id="2837"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Pemberton</hi></persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3096"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Judge Green</hi><hi rend="strikethrough doubleunderline">wood</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">[</hi><hi rend="bold doubleunderline">well</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">]</hi></persName>. In the end, I had to be content with carrying but one of my two resolutions, &amp; withdrawing the other â€“ a lame result. I was somewhat astonished at the strength of feeling against the Master. Evidently there is no confidence in him surviving in anybody's mind. </p>
