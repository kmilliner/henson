The Chapter meeting was peaceful &amp; unimportant. There were traces of the recent crisis in the moroseness of <persName xml:id="590"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Watkins</hi></persName> &amp; the gloom of <persName xml:id="555"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Tucker</hi></persName>: the rest were more at their ease. <hi rend="bold underline">I asked both <persName xml:id="2806">Bayley</persName> and <persName xml:id="2748">Wilson</persName> whether they thought I had done wisely, &amp; both assured me that they did. If I misjudge then not, they are sincere men. It was rather a sudden resolution thus to 'have it out' with my colleagues, but I begin to think it may have been the right thing to do. In any case they know something more of the Man who presides over them.</hi></p>

We (i.e. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I ) travelled to Windsor in order to spend the weekend with the <persName xml:id="203">Provost of Eton</persName>. We left Durham at 12.25 noon and arrived in Windsor Station at 7.33 p.m. We drove to Eton, &amp; arrived in time to dress hastily for dinner.</p>
