         <p>Had Stoicks &amp; others, that hold all passions to be unbeseeming wise men, well discerned betwixt the nature &amp; corruption of passions, they would easily have found out their own mistakings. For anger is as a shepherd's dog, which if it be not at his master's call, to run or return, &amp; do this or that, may be very pernicious: but if he be ordered by his master, he may be very profitable against wolves &amp; thieves.
