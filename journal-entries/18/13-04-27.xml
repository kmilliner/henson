There is certainly a vast difference between laughing at Religion, and laughing at those that profane it, by their extravagant opinions. It were impiety to want a respect for the truths which the Spirit of God hath revealed; but it were no less impiety to want a contempt for the falsities which the spirit of man opposes thereto.</p>

A damp chilly morning. I celebrated at 8 a.m. when there were 34 communicants. Before the Prayer for the Church Militant I invited intercession for the Chinese Nation &amp; Government. The morning post brought an affectionate letter from <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName>.</p>

At Mattins there was a fair (not a large) contingent of the students. The Sermon with the Bidding Prayer was taken at the 3<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi> Collect, &amp; followed by a hymn, &amp; the Benediction, which I gave from my stall. Then the Celebration followed. There were 3 incidents which annoyed me. 1) <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName>  forgot to give out the hymn after the sermon, &amp; I gave it out myself. 2) A large proportion of the congregation left before the sermon: 3) <persName xml:id="555">Bishop Tucker</persName> read by mistake the Proper Preface for Ascension. </p>

The sermon was a wandering rhodomontade, without thought, connection, or relevance. An Apostate in Uganda does not assist the sacred art of the pulpit. </p>

After Evensong <persName xml:id="2748">Wilson</persName> brought me a draft of the letter to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners about the rumoured re&#8211;opening of the Elvet colliery. This I accompanied by a personal letter to <persName xml:id="909">Sir Lewis Dibdin</persName> invoking his good offices in the matter.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="2806">Bailey</persName> &amp; his <persName xml:id="2805">wife</persName> came to an early &amp; informal dinner after which we all attended the musical performance in the cathedral. Mendelsohn's [sic] 'Lobgesang' was well rendered by a numerous company conducted with much vigour by <persName xml:id="2800">Culley</persName>. The cathedral was well filled by the townsfolk in spite of the damp unpleasant weather.</p>
