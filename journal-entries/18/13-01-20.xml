After breakfast I walked into the town, &amp; being desirous to be shaved looked out for Bassett's, but it has vanished. I got shaved in a new shop beyond Queen's. Then I went to the Old Bank, &amp; had a brief interview with the manager, who assented easily to the suggestion that I should transfer my account to the Durham branch. Next I visited the Old&#8211;Furniture shop in Broad Street, &amp; inquired for an oak sideboard: but there was none large enough. I went in to Blackwell's Book Store, &amp; turned over some volumes, but bought nothing save a monograph by <persName xml:id="2858">Haverfield</persName> on <ref xml:id="659">'The Romanization of Roman Britain'</ref>. From Blackwell's I passed to All Souls where I wrote to <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName>, &amp; wasted my time till lunch, which I had in the Buttery with the Fellows. Two juniors, elected last year, <persName xml:id="2719">Williams</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2718">Cruttwell</persName>, seem pleasant &amp; promising: the former designs to take Orders, &amp; the latter is teaching History in Hertford. After lunch I walked to Christ Church, &amp; called on <persName xml:id="250">Watson</persName>, whom I took for a walk in the rain. Then to college again, where I had tea, &amp; read of all things the Arabian Nights! Finally I went to the Union &amp; wrote to <hi rend="bold">[263]</hi> <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName>, &amp; then walked back to the Orchard, where I found some letters awaiting me, but nothing of importance.</p>

<hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="2141">Oman</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2142">his wife</persName> dined with here. He says that <persName xml:id="2876">Bourchier</persName> the 'Times' correspondent in the Balkans, who was dining in college with <persName xml:id="2709">his Editor</persName> last night, says that the d&#x00E9;bacle of the Turks was in large part owing to the ill&#8211;conduct in action of the Christians in the Turkish Regiments, who had been forced into the ranks by the folly of the 'Young Turks', &amp; would not fight against their co&#8211;religionists. Many of these men were captured by the Bulgarians. This is, indeed, a striking example of the Nemesis which pursues the unimaginative obstinacy of intolerance.</hi></p>
