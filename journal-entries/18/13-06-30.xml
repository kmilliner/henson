After breakfast the Bishop took us to see the <orgName xml:id="249">Rylands Library</orgName>, and the <orgName xml:id="250">Chetham Foundation</orgName>. Both are really notable institutions, the latter is also very fascinating &#8211; a relic of the older world surviving in the heart of a modern city. The building is of the 15<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century: the foundation of the 17<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>. There are 100 poor boys fed &amp; educated: and a fine library is maintained.</p>

We came away by the 11.35 a.m. train which reached York at 1.41 p.m. We lunched on the train, &amp; on reaching York went at once to the Cathedral. I was recognized by a civil verger, who shewed us over very politely. We arrived in Durham about 6.30 p.m.</p>
