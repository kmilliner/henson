         <p>"It was less a reform than a transfiguration. The former curves of sensuousness were now modulated to lines of devotional passion. The lip&#8211;shapes that had meant seductiveness were now made to express supplication: the glow on the cheek that yesterday could be translated as riotousness was evangelized today into the splendour of pious enthusiasm; animalism had become fanaticism; Paganism Paulinism; the bold rolling eye that had flashed upon her form in the old time with such mastery now beamed with the rude energy of a theolatry that was almost ferocious. Those black angularities which his face had used to put on when his wishes were thwarted now did duty in picturing the incorrigible backslider who would insist upon turning again to his wallowing in the mire."</p>

         <p>This a terrible picture of a sensual man converted to Methodism: there is no suggestion that the conversion was other than sincere, &amp; it is described as moving the convert to eager &amp; energetic missionary work. Yet it broke down completely and instantly at the contact with the original Temptation.</p>

The service at the Kirk was not well attended: for the Church was certainly less than half full. On the whole I was edified by the proceedings: the sermon was good, though rather too long: the prayers were least to my taste. I was interested at seeing the Decalogue painted large on the wall behind &amp; above the pulpit. This seemed to me as suggestive of the genius of Scottish Protestantism as the Crucifix, very realistic, above the Roman Pulpits is suggestive of the genius of the Jesuits. Both at their best. At their worst both went far away from their distinctive symbols.</hi></p>
