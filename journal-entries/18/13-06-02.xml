I was loth indeed to tear myself away from the Deanery, for everything looked wonderfully winning in the sunlight. However there was no help for it. I left Durham by the 10.29 a.m. train, changing at Darlington. My compagnons de voyage were sufficiently uninteresting &#8211; two nuns ridiculously dressed after their kind, and escorting an amazing boy who appeared half&#8211;witted!</p>

I reached the Deanery shortly before 5 p.m.: and, declining my hostess's suggestion that I should go with her to some sort of religious meeting at Westminster, I walked round to King Edward Street, &amp; called on <persName xml:id="122">Hine Haycock</persName>. He was at home, &amp; we had some agreeable converse, after which we walked together on the Embankment.

We had a very pleasant evening.</p>
