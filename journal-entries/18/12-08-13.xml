Art thou secure, &amp; yet hast sinned? It is because thou fearest no executioner. Thou fearest not him, because there's none to judge thee. There's none to judge because there's no accuser. There's none to accuse, because there's none to witness. There is no witness because thy sin is secret. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Thou fool, thou hast all these within thyself</hi>. Thy conscience is them all, accuser, witness, jury, judge, executioner. Thou hast a court within thy heart, the court indeed of Conscience. For conscience there acts all these offices &#8211; indites, convicts, condemns &amp; executes.</p>
