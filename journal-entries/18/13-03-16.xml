<hi rend="bold">Palm Sunday, March 16</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1913.</hi></p>
         <p>
A fine day but very cold. The early post brought a letter from <persName xml:id="600"><hi rend="bold underline">Ernest Rudling</hi></persName> very discontented &amp; despairing. I wrote a reply which will probably seem to him unkind, but was the kindest thing I could find to say.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="473">Knowling</persName> preached an admirable little sermon at Mattins. I celebrated. There were but 11 communicants including 4 clergy.</p>
         <p>
At Evensong I preached for the first time in the Cathedral. As there was to be a collection for the <orgName xml:id="198">Bible Society</orgName>, I chose the Bible as my subject: &amp; in the course of the sermon made the announcement <hi rend="underline">that the Revised Version would from Easter onwards be read in the public services of the Cathedral</hi>. There was a large congregation, &amp; I could not desire a more attentive one. Whether everybody could hear what I said may be doubtful: but I infer from the stillness &amp; fixity that most people heard fairly well.</p>
         <p>
After service I tool Logic for a walk as far as the Observatory, from which a truly magnificent view of the Cathedral &amp; Castle was gained. There can be few if any finer prospects, in existence.</p>
