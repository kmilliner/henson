<hi>I celebrated in the Cathedral at 8 a.m., bethinking me sadly of the faults &amp; failures of my 26 years' ministry. The Ordination was impressively performed. I joined in the laying on of hands, and ministered the Paten. I attended Evensong in the Cathedral: &amp; afterwards preached in S. Nicholas' Church. There was a considerable congregation. The service was hearty, but the officiating gave me an impression of laboured unctuousness, which was distinctly unpleasing.</hi>
