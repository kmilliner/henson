<hi rend="underline">The excitement of <persName xml:id="1243">Jane Fleet's</persName> arrival</hi>, &amp; my sitting up rather later than usual, may perhaps explain the fact that I had rather a bad night, &amp; wasn't fit for much in the morning.</p>
         <p>
I wrote letters, made a start at an article on my American impressions, &amp; attended Evensong. Then I walked the two girls round the wood to see the bluebells. Finally I wound up dining at the Castle with <persName xml:id="2920">Gee</persName>. <persName xml:id="2748">Wilson</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2918">Apperly</persName> were also there. I was well impressed by <persName xml:id="2919"><hi rend="underline">M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="underline"> P. S. Brown</hi></persName>, Hatfield Hall, an economist, who has been working with the <orgName xml:id="225">Worker's Association</orgName>.
