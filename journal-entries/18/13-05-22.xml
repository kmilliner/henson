<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I went to Stockton&#8211;on&#8211;Tees, where I had undertaken to distribute prizes in the Queen Victoria High School for girls. We were met at the railway station by <persName xml:id="3138">Sir Frank Brown</persName>, the Chairman of the Governors, who motored us to his house, 'Norton Priory', &amp; entertained us at lunch. When this meal was over we proceeded to the school, &amp; went through our little programme. A considerable company of parents &amp; friends had come together, &amp; the children made a brave show. Before giving the prizes, I made a speech on Female Education, which seemed to give satisfaction. Then we returned to Durham. Here I found a letter from <persName xml:id="1204">Mary Scott</persName>, saying that she was going immediately to Canada, in response to a cable from her <persName xml:id="1614">sister</persName>, whose husband, <persName xml:id="1615"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Dr Alcock</hi></persName>, is said to be very seriously ill, indeed probably dying.</p>
         <p>
After dinner I wrote letters, &amp; then read out to Ella from the '<hi rend="underline">Times'</hi> the full report of <persName xml:id="3139">Captain Evans'</persName> narrative of the <persName xml:id="2982">Scott</persName> Antarctic Expedition, delivered last night in the Albert Hall to the members of the <orgName xml:id="197">Royal Geographical Society</orgName>.</p>
