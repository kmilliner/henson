         <p>A dreary wet morning. I felt a miserable wreck with lumbago in my bones &amp; muscles, &amp; an abominable headache. However, I celebrated at 8 a.m. There were about 100 cts; the boys of the grammar school forming a substantial contribution. Mattins &amp; Litany were read at 10 a.m: &amp; the "Athanasian Creed" was said. Then followed the Choral Eucharist at which <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName> celebrated, and I preached. There was but a small number of com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>. Perhaps there may have been 40.</p>
         <p>My text was I Cor. XV.22. "As in Adam all die: even so in Christ shall all be made alive."</p>
         <p>At Evensong we had much music, and well sung. The Revised Version was read in the Cathedral for the first time. There was a large congregation.</p>
