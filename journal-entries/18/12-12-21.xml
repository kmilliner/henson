<hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="1173">Willie Temple</persName> came to see me after breakfast. He has received the offer of this Canonry &amp; rectory: &amp; is considering whether he shall accept it. I encouraged him to do so; &amp; he left me with the impression that such would be his decision</hi>. It appears that the Prime Minister first offered this place to <persName xml:id="1899">Canon Storr</persName>, &amp; that, on his declining it on the ground of health, he offered it to Temple.</p>
         <p>
<hi>We dined at the Deanery, &amp; there met <persName xml:id="2955">Canon Carnegie</persName>, who is generally designated as my successor.</hi>
