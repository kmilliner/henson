         <p>
A drenching day. At 8 a.m. I celebrated the Holy Communion in <orgName xml:id="16">S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's</orgName>. There were no communicants save <persName xml:id="800">Westlake</persName>, <persName xml:id="1033">Ramsay</persName>, &amp; myself.</p>
         <p>
The morning I devoted to a rather barren effort to compose a sermon for Sunday night. Then a lady with a tragic divorce&#8211;story came for advice.</p>
         <p>
In the afternoon I went to the carol&#8211;singing in the Abbey Church. The continual rain made the congregation unusually small.</p>
         <p>
A note from <persName xml:id="156">Fedarb</persName> informed me that <persName xml:id="2741">his wife</persName> died this morning. This is an untoward event which comes at an ill moment. I walked round &amp; saw him at once. They had been married 45 years.</p>
         <p>
We dined with <persName xml:id="728">Lady Flower</persName>. It was a family party.
