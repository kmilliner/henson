There was heavy rain during the night, &amp; the morning was dull &amp; humid. I had breakfast by myself, and was then fetched to <persName xml:id="3042"><hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Mackenzie's</hi></persName><hi> Theological College, where I addressed the students. </hi><persName xml:id="3043"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop Brewster</hi></persName> <hi> was among the audience. I summed up my speech in the four counsels. 1. Read large books. 2. Know the texts. 3. Verify your references. 4. Have some hobby. I bade them take a high &amp; a long view of their work: reminded them that personal Religion must be the basis of spiritual witness, &amp; the condition of spiritual success: &amp; gave them the motto, '</hi><hi rend="underline">Manus ad clarum: oculus ad caelum</hi><hi>'.</hi><note xml:id="162" n="1"></note>

<persName xml:id="3041">Mine host</persName> told me that <persName xml:id="3013">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Pierpoint Morgan</persName> is his uncle; being his mother's brother. He took me to see the old episcopal church where he &amp; his family had worshipped for several generations &#8211; a tasteless structure rather absurdly called Gothic. Leaving him at his office, I rejoined the rest of the party, &amp; went to see the State Library. We inspected the original charter of Connecticut adorned with a 'speaking likeness' of Charles II: &amp; the table on which Lincoln signed the Decree of Negro Emancipation. The young lady in charge had been one of my auditors last night, &amp; was eager to shew us civility. She wrote her name

<hi> on a card, &amp; gave it to me: &#8211; Helen M. Bissell, Memorial Hall, Hartford, Conn. &#8211; &amp; told me she had never been in England.</hi>

<hi>When we arrived at New Haven, we had expected our friends to meet us: &amp; when we failed to find them on the platform, were at first somewhat disconcerted: but we went on to a tram&#8211;car, &amp; reached our destination without difficulty.
