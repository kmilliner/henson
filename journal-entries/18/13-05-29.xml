The Chapter met at noon in order to elect <orgName xml:id="178">King's Scholars</orgName>. Reports were presented by the Examiner, &amp; accepted – we then agreed on the amounts to be awarded to the successful candidates who were summoned into the Chapter house. I informed them of their success, made some comments on their work, &amp; added a few words of general counsel.</p>

After Evensong the Choir followed the Clergy to the top of the great Tower, &amp; there sang 3 anthems at the North, East &amp; South sides of the Tower. The rain fell heavily the while, but even so the ceremony was not without impressiveness. The custom is said to run back to the Battle of Neville's Cross, &amp; to have acquired fresh associations at the Restoration.<note xml:id="77" n="1"></note></p>
