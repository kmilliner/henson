<hi rend="bold">Saturday, August 31</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">st</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1912. Little Metis.</hi></p>
         <p>A glorious day, but with the bite of autumn in the air. The morning I spent in the effort to complete those hapless lectures. <persName xml:id="2821">Professor Cappon</persName> (English Literature) came to (midday) dinner. We had much interesting conversation mainly on politics. He is more sanguine than I think reasonable as to the international situation but therein he is a representative Canadian.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon we drove up to <persName xml:id="2739">our host's</persName> lake, about 600 feet, over a road entirely worthy of standing alongside that from the railway station. My companion was <persName xml:id="2822" display="no"><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Scott</hi></persName>, an official of the Grand Trunk R<hi rend="superscript underline">y</hi>., an intelligent man who accompanied by <persName xml:id="2823" display="no">his wife</persName> had just completed a tour of 8000 miles in 23 days, all within the dominion. <hi rend="italic">I quoted to him </hi><persName xml:id="813"><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Rawle's</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> opinion that the present Canadian boom was bound to be followed by a 'slump': &amp;, rather to my surprise, he expressed his agreement.</hi> He said the speculating advertizers [sic] were doing much harm to the country. The lake surrounded by varied timber, in which autumnal colours were just beginning to invade, was a romantically beautiful spot. A 'loon' or great Northern diver was crying its weird call on the bank, as we arrived. Mine host &amp; I in one boat, <hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Scott</hi> &amp; '<hi rend="doubleunderline">Johnnie</hi>' (a French Canadian attendant) in another engaged in trout&#8211;fishing. Though the lake swarmed with fish our combined catch did not amount to more than 20 fish &#8211; mostly small.</p>

         <p>Mine host &amp; I had some conversation after supper as to the conditions of land&#8211;ownership in the Dominion. <hi rend="italic">He said that ownership in fee&#8211;simple was the only tenure recognized. Steps have, however, been taken within recent years to reserve to the state some of the natural resources. Thus minerals, water&#8211;power, &amp; all lakes cannot any longer be purchased. I inquired how he himself had acquired possession of his lakes, &amp; he replied that the law did not apply to the ancient tenures. He had purchased privately owned waters.</hi></p>
         <p><hi rend="underline">The Church in Little Metis was carried on as a 'Union Church' (i.e. a church in which Episcopalians &amp; Presbyterians worshipped together) until about 3 years ago, when the <persName xml:id="2824">Anglican Bishop</persName>, a stiff High Churchman, dissolved the unity, &amp; built a separate church for the Episcopalians. There was a </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">pretext</hi><hi rend="underline"> for his action in the increase of population, which appeared to demand an increase of church&#8211;accommodation, but the </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">reason</hi><hi rend="underline"> was found in his Lordship's antipathy to the principle &amp; method of such denominational federation, &amp; his motives were so evident that the procedure was not effected without arousing resentments &amp; suspicions in a sphere which had been happily free from both. Such are the normal contributions of the Episcopate to the cause of religious reunion</hi>! </p>
