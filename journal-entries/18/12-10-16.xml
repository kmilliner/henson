<hi>A most lovely morning, our lordly room gave free entrance to the sunshine; &amp; when we had enjoyed our tea brought to us after the comfortable English fashion, we indulged the delusion that we also were of the Great World, which has its place in the sun. The squalid necessity of making out our route to Schenectady &amp; Ithaca destroyed the illusion.</hi></p>

<hi>When we came down to breakfast, we learned that there had been a fire in the house during the night. It was easily put out by the fire engine; but there must have been considerable hustlement: &amp; we slept through it all! After breakfast the <persName xml:id="3055">Governor</persName> walked us both to </hi><hi rend="bold underline">the Capitol &#8211; a building which has become proverbial as an example of municipal extravagance, incompetence, &amp;, as some wd. add, dishonesty.</hi> <hi>He took us into his office and showed us an ample reception room in which twice a week the Governor, like an Oriental Kadi, holds informal reception of the citizens, &amp; hears their complaints &amp; requests. Then he sent us under the direction of an attendant (who didn't know the way) to visit <persName xml:id="2913">Bishop Doane</persName>. The old man wasn't down (it was about 11 a.m.) but his <persName xml:id="3105" display="no">grand&#8211;daughter</persName> was so eager to see us that I promised to call again tomorrow. Then we went to the Education Building, &amp; heard a vivacious paper from </hi><persName xml:id="3106"><hi rend="underline">D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="underline"> William Starr Myers</hi></persName><hi>, Assistant Professor of History &amp; Politics on "The Private Schools: Their place in American Life". I joined the Governor at the Capitol, while <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went back to the Executive Mansion. We were both entertained at semi&#8211;public luncheons. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">My feast at the Fort George Club was preceded by one of those hand&#8211;shaking performances, to which Americans are so strongly attached. The Governor, <persName xml:id="849">Ambassador Reid</persName>, &amp; I stood in a row while all the guests filed by, &amp; shook us by the hand! </hi></p>

Then I hurried home &amp; got my notes for my speech, &amp; my Master's gown. There was a crowded hall. <hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="2087">Murray Butler</persName> spoke with much power &amp; eloquence on "The Aim of the Modern University". His speech occupied nearly Â¾ of an hour in delivery, &amp; was received with great applause</hi>. Then followed <persName xml:id="3108">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Henry S. Pritchell</persName> on "Preparation for the Professions", in a speech of much good sense delivered in a straightforward way, which held the audience. He spoke for half an hour. Then I came, &amp; was received with much applause, the audience rising in their seats. I spoke for half an hour on 'The Value of Historical Studies'. When I sate down the applause was prolonged, rather to my surprize: but the audience were evidently bent on being very polite to an English visitor. After <hi rend="bold underline">this performance I was given a cheque for 100 dollars much to my astonishment</hi>. Then we returned to the Executive Mansion, where <persName xml:id="3071">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Dix</persName> was engaged in 'receiving' the delegates &amp; visitors. Some extremely fine coloured photographs of the autumnal woods were shown. <hi rend="italic">After dinner we all went to the reception at the new building: there, for an endless time, we &#8211; the Governor, M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">rs</hi><hi rend="italic"> Dix, the Chancellor &amp; </hi><persName xml:id="2332" display="no"><hi rend="italic">M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">rs</hi><hi rend="italic"> Reid</hi></persName><hi rend="italic">, Ella &amp; I &#8211; stood in the 'receiving line', &amp; shook hands with several thousands of men, women &amp; youths. The ladies retired for awhile exhausted, &amp; it really was an exhausting performance.</hi>
