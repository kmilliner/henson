<hi rend="italic">I spent the morning indoors, where (my baggage having at last arrived) I endeavoured to make some preparations for tomorrow. But I was much interrupted. First, </hi><persName xml:id="1567"><hi rend="i doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="i superscript doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline"> Symonds</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> called &amp; talked for an hour. I gave him a copy of <ref xml:id="82">'Puritanism in England'</ref>. Then </hi><persName xml:id="2845" display="no"><hi rend="i doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="i superscript doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline"> Price</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> called. He promised to send me the publications of the Forestry Association. Then there came in to me a copy of the '</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Times</hi><hi rend="italic">' for Aug: 24</hi><hi rend="i sup u">th</hi><hi rend="italic"> containing my article on 'Black Bartholomew'<note xml:id="158" n="1"></note>: </hi><hi rend="italic underline">an <ref xml:id="658">Article</ref> on 'The <persName xml:id="2702">Peruvian Amazon Directors</persName><persName xml:id="2705"></persName><persName xml:id="2706" display="no"></persName> &amp; Canon Henson': &amp; the correspondence which passed between me &amp; those gentlemen, together with a final letter from them which presumably arrived after I had left England</hi><hi rend="italic">.  </hi></p>

After lunch <persName xml:id="2739">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Fleet</persName> carried me off to see a game of Lacrosse. It has many points of likeness to Association Football. Then we walked over the mountain &amp; enjoyed the noble view of the City. </p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="2846"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Parkin</hi></persName>, the Secretary of the <orgName xml:id="221">Rhodes Trustees</orgName>, came to dinner. He had not read the <ref xml:id="662" display="no">Blue book</ref>. So I bestowed one on him. My whole stock seems to be exhausted viz. one to <persName xml:id="2847" display="no">MacTier</persName>, to Fleet, to Parkin.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic bold underline">I observed a mixture of races</hi><hi rend="italic"> as I moved about the city this afternoon, for we traversed a district swarming with </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Jews</hi><hi rend="italic">, we travelled in a car crowded with </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Italian</hi><hi rend="italic"> navvies &amp; </hi><hi rend="italic underline">French Canadians</hi><hi rend="italic">, &amp; we watched a game of Lacrosse amid a number of eager </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Irish</hi><hi rend="italic">. Mine host called my attention to the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Greek</hi><hi rend="italic"> fruit sellers, who, he said, were monopolists of the trade in fruit.</hi></p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">The dominance of the R.C. Church is much in evidence</hi> as one's eye falls on large buildings &#8211; churches, convents, colleges, schools &#8211; in every part of the city. As all these buildings are exempt from taxation the public interest is not obscurely concerned. But, though new&#8211;comers from France are bringing in new spirit, the Church as yet holds its empire.
