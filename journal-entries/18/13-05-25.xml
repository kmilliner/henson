A brilliant summer day &#8211; without a cloud in the sky or breeze in the air: hence it was almost oppressively hot. I preached in chapel to the Boys, whose singing was excellent. My sermon on "The Kingdom of Jesus" was suggested by "Empire Day" which was generally observed yesterday. It was, perhaps, rather '<hi rend="underline">above the heads</hi>' of so young an audience, but they listened very creditably. <persName xml:id="3142"><hi rend="underline">Bobbie Bruce</hi></persName> lunched here to meet us, &amp; afterwards shewed us his room. Then we walked into Windsor, &amp; called on M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Ellison. We next had tea with the <persName xml:id="382">Eliots</persName><persName xml:id="3144" display="no"></persName> at the Deanery, &amp; attended Evensong in S. George's Chapel. The Anthem &#8211; Bach's "Blessing, Glory &amp;c" &#8211; was sung perfectly. After service we called on <persName xml:id="2383">Canon Dalton</persName>, who shewed us the Chapter Garden, &amp; escorted us back to the Provost's House.</p>
