The "White Star" line civilly shifted us to better quarters, so that we had a cabin apiece. <persName xml:id="2672">Lois</persName> turned up in very good time. So we made a pleasant start in the pleasantest of weather: The air was soft, &amp; the sun bright: a gentle haze gave mystery to the huge sky&#8211;scraper blocks, which, as the sun smote on them, had the aspect of a vast palace. The Statue of Liberty made a brave show, as we swept by it: &amp;, in short, we made an excellent beginning. Our motto is 'Carpe diem', &amp; we boldly go to lunch!</hi></p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">The luck held throughout the day. Our cabin was exchanged by the bounty of the Company, so that we had a cabin apiece &#8211; very spacious &amp; comfortable. I wrote no less than 9 letters answering congratulations. We dined comfortably, &amp; went to our beds in peace.</hi></p>
