         <p>
A most amicable chapter in the morning. We presented an edifying spectacle of brethren at unity.</p>
         <p>
In the afternoon we (i.e. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, the <persName xml:id="1243">two girls</persName><persName xml:id="2669"></persName>, &amp; I) drove out to Sherburn, where I was pledged to lay the foundation stone of one of the cottages erected by the <orgName xml:id="235"><hi rend="underline">Durham Aged Mine&#8211;Workers Homes Association</hi></orgName>. There was a considerable company of miners &amp; their wives. Old <persName xml:id="3137">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Wilson</persName>, the labour M.P., made his appearance, looking very grey &amp; ill. <hi rend="italic">I was amused at seeing myself described on the stone which I laid as 'the Right Rev</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic">'!</hi> We all returned to the Deanery, but I came back to Sherburn later, &amp; took part in a meeting which was very well attended. Wilson presided, &amp; made rather a long but interesting speech in which he talked 'large' about labour politics. I followed with a speech which was extremely well&#8211;received. Indeed I was surprised at the <hi rend="underline">demonstrativeness</hi> of the audience.</p>
         <p>
The <persName xml:id="276">Bishop</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2797">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Moule</persName> arrived for the Ordination, also <persName xml:id="2952">Archdeacon Price</persName>.</p>
