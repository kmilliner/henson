         <p>I celebrated in the Cathedral at 8 a.m. <persName xml:id="2693" display="no">Olive</persName> made her first communion. I had gone through the service carefully with her overnight, &amp; she was supported by two of her colleagues, as well as by <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>.</p>
         <p>The Archdeacon of Auckland (<persName xml:id="2952">Price</persName>) preached at Mattins. His text was David's sin in numbering Israel, &amp; his sermon an exhortation to a more vivid faith in Divine Providence. <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName> celebrated at midday.</p>
         <p>After lunch <persName xml:id="1095">Aubry</persName>, <persName xml:id="2936">Boden</persName>, and I walked round the wood, &amp; then attended Evensong in the Cathedral.</p>

A few days ago he contributed to the 'Times' a memoir of <persName xml:id="2776">George Wyndham</persName>. Now he has followed his friend to the tomb. The loss of these men to the Unionist Party is very serious.</hi>
