A day of disasters! I went to Stockton&#8211;on&#8211;Tees in order to make a speech at a garden party in aid of the C. of E. Waifs &amp; Society. But the train was late, &amp; lost its connexion at Ferryhill, so that I found myself stranded at that detestable junction with the prospect of 3 hours' waiting. I returned to Durham, lunched at home, &amp; brought out <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> by the later train. We were met at Ferryhill by our garden&#8211;party host's car, &amp; motored (in top&#8211;hat &amp; Gainsborough!) at break&#8211;neck speed to the scene of action. Here I made a speech &amp; we had tea. Returning, I lost my pocket diary with the list of my engagements.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic bold underline">After dinner I wrote a long letter to <persName xml:id="215">Asquith</persName> respecting the vacant canonry at Westminster. I begged him to consider four names which I set down in the order of my personal preference. These were 1. <persName xml:id="216">Gow</persName>, 2. <persName xml:id="117">Rashdall</persName>, 3. <persName xml:id="1820">Charles</persName>, 4. <persName xml:id="3172">Kirsopp Lake</persName></hi><hi rend="i bold">.</hi></p>

On Tuesday, the 24<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> June 1913, the Judge (<persName xml:id="3168">Rowlatt</persName>) and the Commissioner (<persName xml:id="3169">English Harrison</persName>) came to dinner with their marshalls. With some difficulty we got together a company to meet them. Two of the choir boys came in, &amp; sang grace <hi rend="underline">more antiguo</hi>.</p>
         <p>
On Wednesday, June 25<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, I made an inspection of the Choir School, which seemed to me very unsatisfactory from the point of fire&#8211;risks. We lunched with the <persName xml:id="2660">Robinsons</persName><persName xml:id="2661"></persName>. I attended the Confirmation in the Cathedral. <persName xml:id="2693" display="no">Olive</persName> was confirmed. I gave her a Bible.</p>
         <p>
On Thursday, June 26<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Ella went to Ripon for the Choir Festival. I wrote a letter to the 'Times' on the Representation of the Laity.</p>
         <p>
M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Justice Rowlatt &amp; his marshall had tea with me: &amp; afterwards I shewed them over the Cathedral.</p>
         <p>
