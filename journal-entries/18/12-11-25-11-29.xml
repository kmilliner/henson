This day I maintained my position on deck, and at meals: but with increasing discomfort. On Tuesday morning I appeared at breakfast feeling lamentable: &amp; then collapsed before the malignant &amp; waxing forces of the deep. Tuesday &amp; Wednesday were spent woefully in my cabin: on Thursday I re&#8211;appeared on deck: &amp; on Friday had resumed all the habits of normal health. But we had then got into the narrow seas, &amp; left the Atlantic behind us.</p>
         <p>
We reached Queenstown about 4 a.m. on Friday morning, Nov. 29<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>: &amp; there got in a stock of English newspapers. Three items of intelligence interested me variously. (1) <persName xml:id="2731">Moneypenny</persName>, the editor of <persName xml:id="2732" display="no">Disraeli's</persName> life has died, leaving his work unfinished. (2) <persName xml:id="2733">Lansbury</persName>, the vapid Socialist, has been turned out of Bow &amp; Bromley by a handsome majority. (3) A formidable list of Buckinghamshire laymen have protested to <persName xml:id="49">Gore</persName> against his proposed division of the Oxford diocese.</p>
         <p>
I finished reading <persName xml:id="2734">Wells'</persName> <ref xml:id="666">"Marriage"</ref>, which interested &amp; impressed me. It is a strong book, saner than I looked for from that author.</p>
