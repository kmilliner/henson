<hi rend="italic bold underline">Today I witnessed for the second time the Coronation of an English King</hi><hi rend="italic">. The great Solemnity was accomplished without accident of any kind. I was much impressed by the sincere &amp; severest demeanour of their Majesties. The presence of their children added a touch of true pathos to the splendid pageant. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">No one could observe the manly &amp; modest carriage of the young Prince of Wales without auguring well of the future of the British Monarchy</hi><hi rend="italic">.  The 
<persName xml:id="325">Dean</persName> performed his functions, but with evident difficulty. </hi>
<persName xml:id="130"><hi rend="italic bold underline">Lang</hi></persName><hi rend="italic bold underline"> delivered himself of platitudes very effectively for the five minutes allotted to him</hi><hi rend="italic">.  The 
<persName xml:id="128">Archbishop of Canterbury</persName> has a monotonous and wearying manner: but he got through without accident.  The cheering as the King came down the Church after the ceremony was inadequate.  It gave the impression of a certain hesitation as the fitness of such a demonstration within sacred walls.</hi>
