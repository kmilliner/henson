         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's at 8 a.m.  There were 19 comts., all female save 
<persName xml:id="1485" display="no"><hi rend="bold underline">Ramsey</hi></persName>, 
<persName xml:id="1208"><hi rend="bold underline">Gilbert Box</hi></persName>, &amp; myself.</p>
         <p>There was a very large congregation at 11 a.m. when 
<persName xml:id="427"><hi rend="bold underline">Inge</hi></persName> preached a fine sermon from the words &#8211; "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"  
<persName xml:id="800"><hi rend="bold underline">Westlake</hi></persName> celebrated the Communion afterwards.  There were 59 communicants.</p>
         <p>I preached in the Abbey at 3 p.m. very tiresomely!  At Evensong S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's was crowded.  I preached a short sermon.</p>

         <p>On <hi rend="underline">Ash Wednesday, Feb. 21</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi><hi rend="underline"> 1912</hi>, I celebrated in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Marg<hi rend="superscript underline">t's</hi> at 8 a.m.: and preached at 11 a.m.  
<persName xml:id="636"><hi rend="bold underline">Pearce</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> preached his first sermon in Abbey at 3 p.m.</hi>  He has a good voice, and plenty of good stuff: but his delivery is artificial, &amp; he has contracted some mannerisms from S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Paul's.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">At 5.30 p.m. </hi>
<persName xml:id="2238"><hi rend="italic bold underline">Thompson</hi></persName><hi rend="italic bold underline"> delivered his first lecture on 'Miracles &amp; the Christian Faith' in St Marg</hi><hi rend="i bold superscript underline">t's</hi><hi rend="italic">. There was a good congregation, mainly of men. The lecture was clear &amp; outspoken: but delivered in so low a voice that I doubt whether it could be heard. I like the man himself. He is simple, modest, &amp; well&#8211;mannered.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Now I found myself stricken down with a chill.  On Friday I could not deliver my opening Lecture on 'Puritanism in England': 
<persName xml:id="122"><hi rend="bold underline">Hine&#8211;Haycock</hi></persName> read it for me.  Very inconveniently I had to cancel my Confirmation classes.</p>
