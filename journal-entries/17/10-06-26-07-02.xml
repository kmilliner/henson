         <p>The weather has suddenly become much cooler.  At 8 a.m. I celebrated in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's.  There were 23 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> including 
<persName xml:id="590">Archdeacon Watkins</persName> &amp;

He preached well, has a good voice &amp; manages it well, &amp; arranges his matter effectively.  The type of discourse, perhaps, was rather old&#8211;fashioned.  Certainly the attention of the audience was close &amp; sustained.</hi>

         <p><hi rend="italic">In the afternoon, 
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I went to the

         <p><hi rend="italic">At Evensong there was a very large congregation, in which I noticed rather to my surprise, the
