         <p>Fine but very cold.  I celebrated in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m. There were 20 cts; of whom but 6 were males.</p>
         <p>There was a very large congregation at Mattins. I preached on 1. Samuel iii.1 "The word of the Lord was precious in those days: there was no open vision".</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I called on 
<persName xml:id="2132">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Troutbeck</persName> to inquire after 
<persName xml:id="2134">his son</persName>, who is reported ill.</p>
         <p>At Evensong there was, considering the weather, a fair Congregation.  I preached from Psalm 42.1. "As the hart panteth after the water&#8211;brooks: so panteth my soul after Thee, O God."</p>

         <p><hi rend="italic">The sinister announcement in the "Times" of last Wednesday that 
<persName xml:id="2243">Farrar's</persName> appointment as Chaplain in Ordinary to the King, &amp; as Domestic Chaplain to Queen Alexandra, had been "cancelled", gives rise to much speculation as to the cause. It has an evil look.</hi>

         <p>On Wednesday, the 29<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Nov. I dined with the 
<orgName xml:id="64">'Past Overseers Society'</orgName>, and proposed the Toast of the same.</p>
         <p>On Thursday, the 30<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Nov., I went to S. Margaret's at 8 a.m. &amp; received the Holy Communion.  At noon I conducted the funeral service for 
<persName xml:id="2140">Sir Frederick Scotter</persName>.  <hi rend="bold underline">At 2.30 p.m. I attended the baptism in S. Paul's Cathedral of </hi>
<persName xml:id="2067"><hi rend="bold underline">Margaret Paula Inge</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline">, and made responses as her Godfather</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi>

<persName xml:id="2139">Sir Archibald Gerkie</persName> presided.</p>
         <p>On Friday, December 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi>, I attended a meeting of Hospital Managers gathered from all parts of the country to protest against the treatment which the Insurance Bill metes out to the Hospitals.  
<persName xml:id="539">Alfred Lyttleton</persName> moved, &amp; I seconded a resolution.

<persName xml:id="325">Dean's</persName> on "The Hymns of the first Christmas".  It was very simple &amp; orthodox.</p>
