         </p>
         <p>We dined with 
<persName xml:id="2642">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Yerburgh</persName> M.P. for Chester, at his house 25 Kensington Gore.  The dinner party numbered no less than 30 persons.  I took down to dinner the Authoress, 
<persName xml:id="2643">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Forbes</persName>, a rather uncanny&#8211;looking female who, however, was agreeable &amp; talkative.  The house is full of pictures.  Sir Joshua Reynolds, Gainsborough, Romney, &amp; more modern painters have been drawn upon to cover the walls with things of beauty.  The pictures were collected by 
<persName xml:id="2644">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Yerburgh's</persName> father, 
<persName xml:id="2645">Thwaites</persName>.  She told me &#8211; no, one of the guests who professed to be her intimate friend from the cradle &#8211; that the noble picture, "The ladies Waldegrave", had originally cost &#x00A3;19,000: &amp; was now valued at &#x00A3;100,000.  It had been scheduled as an heir&#8211;loom, &amp; paid no Death&#8211;duties.  There were water&#8211;colours by Turner in the lower room, &amp; in truth the house combined the charms of a palace &amp; a picture&#8211;gallery.</p>
         <p>My <ref xml:id="610">letter</ref> headed, 'A case of Counter&#8211;Appeals with a difference', appeared in this morning's "Times".</p>

<persName xml:id="2428">Sir George White</persName>, the hero of Ladysmith, died yesterday: Alma&#8211;Tadema the painter died today.</p>
