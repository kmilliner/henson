         <p>There were 18 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at 8 a.m.  At Mattins the church was crowded. <hi rend="i bold">[</hi><hi rend="italic">I preached on the final authoritativeness of the Apostolic version of the Founder.

<persName xml:id="747" display="no">Capt<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi> Butler</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="274">Uncle Charles</persName>, &amp; quite a number of clergymen were present.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I went to Harringay Cong<hi rend="superscript underline">l</hi> Church &amp; gave an address on "Old Religion and New Theology".  It was really a short summary of my two sermons.  In spite of the rain, there was a large assembly mostly of men.</p>
         <p>A note from 
<persName xml:id="2041" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Miller</persName> told me that the 
<persName xml:id="2013" display="no">Captain</persName> died this morning.</p>
         <p>The congregation at Evensong was reduced by the rain.  I preached an old sermon, written 12 years ago at Ilford on the Beatitude: 'Blessed are they that hunger &amp; thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled."</p>

         <p>On Thursday, Nov. 4<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1909, Captain Miller was buried with military honours at Aldershot.  I attended a little service in the chapel of the Hospital, and took part with the Presbyterian Chaplain in conducting it.</p>
         <p>On Friday, Guy Fawkes Day, I dined as 
<persName xml:id="2042" display="no">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Roxburgh's</persName> guest with the 
<orgName xml:id="164" display="no">Glasgow University Club</orgName> in the Gaiety Restaurant.  As another guest had failed to appear, <hi rend="bold underline">I was translated to his seat beside the Chairman, 
<persName xml:id="292">Lord Rosebery</persName>: &amp; made response to the toast of the guests.  It was the first occasion on which I had had any conversation with that enigmatic person.  He was affable, &amp; pleased to talk about himself</hi>.</p>
