         <p>A wet day with brief interludes of hypocritical sunshine.  
<persName xml:id="227">Murray</persName> motored us to Ruthwell, where we inspected the famous cross in the parish church.  I attempted to take some photographs, but, I fear, my labour was thrown away.  Then we went on to Arran, where I tried in vain to get some more films.</p>
         <p>After lunch mine host and I walked for awhile, the weather mending.  Then having had tea, I sate in the Garden &amp; read the "Times".  The 
<persName xml:id="387">Dean of Lincoln</persName> is reported to be seriously ill with pneumonia in Switzerland.  I should genuinely regret his death, for his gentle &amp; tolerant character did me good.  Then I wrote letters.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">While I sate alone in the garden a willow&#8211;wren came hopping about me, and, as I sate still, it became ever bolder until finally it perched on my hand, &amp; hopped about on my person</hi>.</p>
