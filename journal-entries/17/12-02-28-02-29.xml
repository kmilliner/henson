         <p>I finished the second of the Lectures on 'Puritanism', &amp; then walked into the city &amp; changed a cheque.</p>

<persName xml:id="2238"><hi rend="italic bold underline">Thompson</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> gave his second lecture in S</hi><hi rend="i sup u">t</hi><hi rend="italic"> Margaret's.

         <p>In the evening I attended the great Demonstration against female suffrage.  
<persName xml:id="1592"><hi rend="bold underline">Lord Cromer</hi></persName> was in the Chair: 
<persName xml:id="1018">Lord Curzon</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="1261">Miss Markham</persName>, M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Harcourt, &amp; F. E. Smith the speakers.  The two ministers were subjected to some interruption by Suffragettes.

         <p>On Wednesday evening (February 28<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1912) I attended the great Anti&#8211;Female Suffrage Meeting at the Albert Hall.  The speech of the evening was certainly made by 
<persName xml:id="1261">Violet Markham</persName>.  Indeed, though the other speakers were well listened to, her speech was the only one which really moved the audience.</p>
         <p>On Thursday morning (Feb. 29<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>) 
<persName xml:id="708"><hi rend="bold underline">John Troutbeck</hi></persName> the coroner died.  Two days ago he was operated on for appendicitis, &amp; yesterday he seemed progressing favourably enough: now he has gone.  He was just 3 years older than I am.</p>
         <p>My lecture in the Abbey on Friday afternoon was dull &amp; everyway depressing.  <hi rend="bold underline">The truth is that the Coal Strike obsesses all minds</hi><hi rend="bold">.  </hi>This afternoon took place a monstrous window&#8211;smashing raid by the militant female&#8211;suffragists.  148 arrests were made, &amp; about &#x00A3;5000 worth of property was destroyed.  This strange folly adds emphasis to the arguments of Wednesday.</p>
