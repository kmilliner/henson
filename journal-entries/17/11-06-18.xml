         <p>A low and falling glass, gusts of wind carrying showers of rain, and an overcast, threatening sky, gave ill promise of the day.  I celebrated at 8 a.m.  There are 32 cts.</p>
         <p>The wind was so strong about 10.30 a.m. that it stripped off the awning above the 'Grand Stand' on the Churchyard, &amp; this as it flapped about began to demolish the frame which had carried it.  The police stopped the path through the Churchyard, &amp; sent for the builders.</p>

         <p>At Evensong, the Church was well&#8211;filled, but by no means crowded.  I preached again for the Hospitals.  The Offertory exceeded &#x00A3;28.</p>
