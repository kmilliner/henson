         <p>The sun is streaming gloriously into my tent.  There is silence in the camp, for the 
<orgName xml:id="209">London Scottish</orgName> have gone, &amp; on Sunday we don't get up so early as on other days.  Some of the young men have begged me to celebrate the Holy Communion at 7 a.m.: and I have consented willingly enough, though I must improvise the sacred vessels with a tumbler &amp; a plate!  I spoke to the 
<persName xml:id="2575" display="no">Colonel</persName>, and ascertained that he had no objection.</p>
         <p>About 18 officers &amp; men including the Colonel &amp; the 
<persName xml:id="2576" display="no">Adjutant</persName> communicated.  It was explained to me afterwards that the men breakfasted at 7 a.m., &amp; were therefore prevented from attending.</p>
         <p>The camp was alive with troops going off after their first week's service.  There were so many marching out escorted by the curious cheers of their comrades that I feared lest none would remain for my congregation.</p>
         <p>The men were drawn up in a hollow square &#8211; three sides of it: I stood on a box on the missing side with the band beside me.  Though I thus secured such assistance as the wind could give, I fear that great part of the men could hear nothing.  However we did our best: &amp; the 
<persName xml:id="2577">Brigadier (Col: Cuthbert)</persName> expressed himself very warmly in approval afterwards.  The whole parade was over within Â¾ hour.</p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>Then I went to the Volunteer Service of the Wesleyans, of whom 63 were officially reported to be in camp.  Of these, however, but 11 put in an appearance.  The local Wesleyan Minister, 
<persName xml:id="2578" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Hawkins Hardy</persName>, and 
<persName xml:id="2579" display="no">his wife</persName> bringing a harmonium in a taxi&#8211;cab, arrived to time: &amp; the tiny service proceeded.  The 
<persName xml:id="2571" display="no">Quarter&#8211;master</persName> fetched me out of the tent in order that I might be photographed with the Sergeants &amp; Corporals.  I had already been photographed with the Officers.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I wrote letters to Reggie, 
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName>, &amp; 
<persName xml:id="695" display="no">Herbert Gritten</persName>: visited the Y.M.C.A. tent &amp; talked to 
<persName xml:id="2580" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">c</hi>Au</persName>, and 
<persName xml:id="2581" display="no">Virgo</persName> &#8211; two leading officials.  The latter is an Australian imported for the purpose of 'enthusing' the movement: had tea with my colleagues: &amp; finally took 
<persName xml:id="2582" display="no">Lieu<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> M<hi rend="superscript underline">c</hi>Dougall</persName> for a walk.  We had a very interesting conversation, in which I formed a very high opinion of his powers.</p>
         <p>M<hi rend="superscript underline">c</hi>Dougall accompanied me to the Y.M.C.A. tent, where a religious meeting was in progress. The men were engaged in singing hymns with much ardour.  I addressed them shortly, &amp; was followed by the new Australian secretary.  He is an extremely fluent speaker with a very confident manner: but he is too professional, &amp; apt to degenerate into cheap &amp; vulgar clap&#8211;trap.</p>
