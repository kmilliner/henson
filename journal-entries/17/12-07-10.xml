         </p>
         <p>I went to the Necropolis cemetery at Brookwood, &amp; officiated at the burial of 
<persName xml:id="2090" display="no">Lady Spencer</persName>.  The choir consisted of 4 men &amp; 6 boys: the first came from S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Paul's, the last from a trainer.  They sang excellently.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I attended the 
<persName xml:id="128">Archbishop's</persName> Garden Party at Lambeth.  There was a large party, &amp; we found many acquaintances.  But the Archbishop was nowise civil beyond the barest necessity of convention.</p>
         <p>We dined with the 
<persName xml:id="956">Lord Chancellor</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="1386">Miss Haldane</persName>.  It was a very interesting company.  I took down to dinner 
<persName xml:id="2088" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Murray Butler</persName>, the wife of the Principal of Columbia University.  The 
<persName xml:id="2187">Master of the Rolls</persName> was also present, &amp; made himself very agreeable.</p>
         <p>I received an interesting &amp; lengthy letter from 
<persName xml:id="2089" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Raeburn</persName> of Helensburgh respecting the recent discussion in the 
<orgName xml:id="57">Representative Church Council</orgName>: and also an affectionate letter from my dear 
<persName xml:id="1204">Mary</persName>.</p>
