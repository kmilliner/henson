         <p>Another bad day following the now well established precedent of an hypocritical start.  I went to his home with 
<persName xml:id="2389" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> M<hi rend="superscript underline">c</hi>Dougall</persName>, and returned before lunch &#8211; motor closed because of the rain.  Everywhere are the tokens of destructive storms in flattened crops, and roads deeply trenched.  In the afternoon mine host went a fishing, &amp; I with him.  After two hours in the rain I had caught one small trout, &amp; he two more.  A large heron flapped over the moor: &amp; the grouse rose &amp; fled before it.  
<persName xml:id="2313" display="no">Miss Chichester</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="2314">Stephen's</persName> choice in young ladies, arrived &#8211; a pretty pleasant maiden enough.</p>
         <p>I finished a novel called <ref xml:id="406">"Senator North"</ref> by 
<persName xml:id="2388">Gertrude Atherton</persName>: another picture of modern American life explicating two highly characteristic American phenomena &#8211; the Senate, and the Southern horror of the negroes.</p>

<persName xml:id="230">Sir Charles</persName> tells me that a locomotive costs about &#x00A3;2800: &amp; has an extreme life of 40 years, in the course of which it would wear out 3 boilers.</p>
