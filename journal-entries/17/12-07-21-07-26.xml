         <p>The day was dull &amp; wet, a circumstance which hindered our appreciation of the many beauties of Shrewsbury.</p>
         <p>At 8 a.m. we received the Holy Communion in the Chapel, and at 11 a.m. I preached not very effectively.  But boys are beyond me, &amp; I am never easy in strange pulpits.  
<persName xml:id="777">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Alington</persName> drove us round the town after lunch, &amp; we looked inside two fine churches &#8211; the Abbey &amp; S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Mary's.  In the former was the tomb of a 16<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century 'Speaker Onslow'.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">I had brought the Putumayo Blue&#8211;Book with me, and lent it to 
<persName xml:id="541">Alington</persName> with such effect that he not only spoke to the boys at the evening service about the Rubber Abominations, but wrote a letter to the <ref xml:id="411">Times</ref></hi>. The chapel services pleased me. They were reverent, hearty, &amp; simple &#8211; just what school services ought to be.</p>
         <p>On Monday, the 22<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> July, we came away from Shrewsbury arriving in Westminster about 2 p.m.  
<persName xml:id="76">Mother</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="77">Marion</persName> arrived from Birchington.</p>

         </p>
         <p>On Tuesday, the 23<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi> July, I officiated in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at the marriage of the 
<persName xml:id="2346">Hon: Guy Charteris</persName> and 
<persName xml:id="2347">Miss Tennant</persName>.  There was a great gathering of politicians.  
<persName xml:id="215">Asquith</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="508">Balfour</persName>, &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2343">Wyndham</persName> signed the register.</p>
         <p>On Thursday, the 25<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> July, (S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> James's Day) I celebrated at 8 a.m. in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's.  There were 6 communicants.  At noon I conducted the annual service at the Almshouse, &amp; gave an Address.  After lunch I went to Anerley, &amp; distributed the prizes at a small private school conducted by a parson named 
<persName xml:id="2424" display="no">Wood</persName>, whose acquaintance I made at the meetings of the Freemasons.  It was rather a grotesque function.  I wrote to 
<persName xml:id="1204">Mary</persName>.  <hi rend="bold underline">The </hi>
<persName xml:id="784"><hi rend="bold underline">Speaker</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> sent me a note consenting to my request that he w</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">d</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> allow my volume of </hi><ref xml:id="344"><hi rend="bold underline">sermons</hi></ref><hi rend="bold underline"> to be dedicated to him</hi>.</p>
         <p>On Friday, the 26<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> July, the 
<orgName xml:id="13" display="no">Psycho&#8211;therapeutic Committee</orgName> met at the Deanery in order to take the evidence of 
<persName xml:id="2425" display="no">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> M<hi rend="superscript underline">c</hi>Coomb</persName> from Boston.  As he is one of the leaders of the 
<orgName xml:id="201">Immanuel Movement</orgName> in that city, we were eager to hear what he could tell.  But it came to very little, for he disclaimed everything except such cases as involved a moral problem, mainly alcoholics: &amp; repudiated 
<persName xml:id="2248" display="no">Hickson</persName> &amp; Co. with some energy.</p>
