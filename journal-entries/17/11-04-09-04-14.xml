<hi rend="bold">Palm Sunday, April 9</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1911.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A calm, dull morning.  
<persName xml:id="800">Westlake</persName> celebrated at 8 a.m.  There were 27 cts.</p>
         <p>Rain threatened as church&#8211;time drew on: and some fell during service.  At Mattins there was a fair congregation and a good collection.  I preached on Hebrews ii. 10.: and afterwards celebrated.  There were but 38 cts.</p>
         <p>At Evensong the Church was very full.  I read the Exhortation to Holy Communion, and preached a short sermon on I. Cor: XI. 26.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="1261">Miss Markham</persName> came to supper bringing with her one 
<persName xml:id="2531">Hills</persName> a member of Pal<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi>; also 
<persName xml:id="571">Geordie</persName> &amp; an Austrian friend: 
<persName xml:id="1255">Linetta</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="1256">Ranee</persName>, &amp; 
<persName xml:id="1204">Mary</persName>.</p>
         <p>The Offertories today exceeded &#x00A3;27.</p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>The weather changed suddenly from wintry cold to summerlike warmth.  Holy Week began in January and ended in July.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">

<persName xml:id="2532" display="no">Kitty Gl&#x00FC;nicke</persName> were confirmed in S</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">t</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> John's on Wednesday the 12</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi> <hi rend="bold underline">April</hi>.  I was unable to be present, as I had to be in

         <p>Two Memorial Services gave an unusual melancholy to the week.  On Tuesday, 
<persName xml:id="115">T. R. Buchanan</persName> was buried: and on Thursday, 
<persName xml:id="2086">Sir Alfred Lyall</persName>.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic bold underline">
<persName xml:id="2533">Nickson</persName>, who had accepted the Bpk. of Southwark, has announced his withdrawal from the position.  Ill health is the reason announced in the press: but other reasons are suggested by gossip.  The rhapsodies of self&#8211;gratulation in which the Evangelicals have been indulging have thus turned suddenly to disappointment.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Good Friday, April 14<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> was marked by brilliant weather, &amp; very small congregations.  The latter may, perhaps, have been in some measure connected with the Procession from S. Martin's to S. Paul's, which the 
<persName xml:id="166">Bp. of London</persName> had announced for the afternoon.</p>
