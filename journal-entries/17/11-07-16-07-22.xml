         <p>I preached to the boys from the words: "Quit you like men: be strong:" &amp; discussed the question whether Christianity was rightly described as 'a man's religion'.  
<persName xml:id="2068">Lords Cobham</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="759">Lytton</persName>, &amp; the 
<persName xml:id="3416">Provost of King's</persName> were in the congregation.  The boys were very attentive, &amp; presumably interested.  In the course of the sermon I made an allusion to 
<persName xml:id="604">Sir Eldon Gorst</persName>, who died last week, &amp; was an Etonian.</p>
         <p>We had tea with 
<persName xml:id="2383">Canon Dalton</persName>, &amp; attended the service in S. George's Chapel.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="2549" display="no">Eddie Hamilton</persName> showed us about very kindly.  He has grown into a fine, well&#8211;mannered youth.</p>

         <p>On Tuesday, the 18<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> July, we went to Southampton in order to visit the 
<persName xml:id="1123">Bishop</persName>.  On Wednesday, we motored to Salisbury, where we had tea with the 
<persName xml:id="1332">Dean:</persName> and were shown over the Cathedral by 
<persName xml:id="2550" display="no">Miss Page Roberts</persName>.  I was particularly impressed by the Chapter House &amp; the Cloisters.</p>
         <p>On Thursday, the 20<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> July, we motored to Beaulieu Abbey, and viewed the remains of the Cistercian Abbey.  The Refectory has been adapted for use as a Church.  The present 
<persName xml:id="1709">Lord Montague</persName> has restored the chamber of the Lay Brethren, &amp; made of it an admirable dining hall.  The great church is represented by nothing more than the foundations of the walls &amp; piers, &amp; one ruined door&#8211;way.  Later in the day we motored to Winchester, &amp; there parted with the Bishop who had to go on to Farnham.  In the evening 
<persName xml:id="2551">Sir Alfred Wills</persName> and 
<persName xml:id="2552">his daughter</persName> dined.  He is a fine old man, keen &amp; interesting.</p>
         <p>On Friday, the 21<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> July, we returned to Westminster.  
<persName xml:id="413">Reichel</persName> lunched here.  He is lame but fairly vigorous.  I took Evensong in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's</orgName>.  
<persName xml:id="2553">Canon</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2554" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Douglas</persName> from New York, also 
<persName xml:id="1688" display="no">Kennedy</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2516" display="no">his wife</persName>, dined here.  On Saturday the 22<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> July, we went to Canterbury to visit 
<persName xml:id="383">Archdeacon Spooner</persName>.  We coincided in the train with the 
<persName xml:id="68">Bishop of Croydon</persName>.</p>
