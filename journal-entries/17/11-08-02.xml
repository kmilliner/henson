         <p>We motored with 
<persName xml:id="642">Sir Peile</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2564">Miles</persName> to Kedington, where we visited an interesting but very dilapidated Church.  It contained several fine monuments of the Barnardiston family: a Jacobean pulpit with hour glass attached on a stand: a fine screen of the 14<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century forming one side of a large pew: a screen across the chancel: early 18<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century (or late 17<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>) communion rails north &amp; south as well as west of the Holy Table: many carved XV<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century benches: a fine XIV<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century chest: &amp; a fine open timber roof.  The Incumbent, 
<persName xml:id="2565">Canon Perry</persName>, was in the Church, <hi rend="underline">brushing hassocks.</hi>  A small old fresh coloured, sharp&#8211;tongued man, who resented suggestions as to his church (of which he complained that he had many), &amp; seemed to exult in its dilapidation.</p>
