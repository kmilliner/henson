         <p>~~A veneration for antiquity is not the only thing that abuses and enslaves our mind; the charms of novelty have the same ascendant over us.  And hence arise all the disputes amongst men, who charge each other either with sticking to the false impressions of their childhood, or with running at all adventures into every near hypothesis &amp; fancy.~~</p>

         <p>A bright morning.  
<persName xml:id="800">Westlake</persName> celebrated at 8 a.m.  I assisted.  There were 27 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>At Mattins there was a large congregation.  I preached on the words, "What God hath cleansed: make not thou common".  Afterwards I celebrated.  There were 97 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>

<persName xml:id="2406"><hi rend="underline">Brooke</hi></persName>, of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> John's, Kennington, is reported to have died suddenly.  As I was about to start for the 
<orgName xml:id="116">Stockwell Training College</orgName>, where I had promised to address the students, I received a telegram announcing the death of 
<persName xml:id="1694" display="no"><hi rend="underline">Miss Manley</hi></persName>, the principal.  I had to adapt my discourse to the situation.  
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went with me to the College.</p>
         <p>The 
<persName xml:id="625">Bp. of Stepney</persName> preached at Evensong for C.E.T.S.: and afterwards came in to supper.  A good &amp; pleasant man but too ecstatic, verbose, and declamatory.</p>

<orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName> met on Tuesday, the 4<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> of July, and continued its session until Friday, the 7<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>.  There was one more attempt on the part of 
<persName xml:id="212">Dean Wace</persName> in company with 
<persName xml:id="385">Canon Newbolt</persName> to obstruct Prayer book Revision: but they were easily defeated (55 to 29) almost without discussion.  A report on Cremation signed by 
<persName xml:id="49">Bp. Gore</persName> proposed that service sh<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> take place at the Crematorium. I carried an Amendment recommending that the service sh<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> concern itself with the ashes.</p>
         <p>We carried Prayer&#8211;book revision a few stages further by passing some part of the 
<orgName xml:id="48" display="no">Revision Committee's</orgName> proposals, including a revision of the opening exhortation of the marriage service. I made a speech on this subject which was well received by the House.</p>
