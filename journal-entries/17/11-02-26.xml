         <p>A bright cold morning.  I celebrated at 8 a.m.  There were but 9 cts.</p>
         <p>At Mattins there was a large but not crowded congregation.  I preached from the 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> Lesson &#8211; Genesis ix. 6: and was listened to with remarkable attention: no coughing at all.  This demonstrates the true cause of coughing &#8211; inattention!  The 
<persName xml:id="280">Bishop of Ripon</persName> was in church, &amp; came in to the Vestry afterwards.  So did 
<persName xml:id="2069">Sir John Barran B<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi></persName>, M.P. for Hawick &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2070" display="no">his wife</persName>, who is daughter of 
<persName xml:id="2071" display="no">Leighton Parks</persName>, the Rector of S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Bartholomew's, New York.</p>
         <p>After lunch I travelled to Godalming.  At the station 
<persName xml:id="2504">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Rendal</persName> met me, &amp; carried me to Charterhouse.  The brightness of the day &amp; the freshness of the air made the beautiful place peculiarly delightful.  I preached to the boys in the chapel, not very happily, the coughing being terrible!  Afterwards I returned to town in company with one of the 
<orgName xml:id="31">Westminster</orgName> Masters, with whom I had much interesting conversation.  I got home about 11.30 p.m.</p>
