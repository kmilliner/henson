         <p>There was an alarm during the night, a consequence of the fracas in the 
<orgName xml:id="209">London Scottish</orgName> lines on Friday afternoon, when two men were captured in the act of stealing whisky!  Their punishment was prompt, rapid, &amp; indescribable.  When finally they were released, they fled leaving their waggon in their captors' hands.  To recover this trophy appears to have been the cause of a night expedition on the part of their comrades.  Anyway the discovery of their presence provoked much excitement, they were captured, &amp; imprisoned till the morning, when, there being no evidence of anything criminal against them, they were suffered to depart.</p>
         <p>At 5 a.m. the Band played "<hi rend="underline">Father O'Flynn</hi>" with much vigour outside my tent.  I watched Battalion drill, breakfasted at 7.30 a.m., was driven to the station by the 
<persName xml:id="2571" display="no">Quarter&#8211;master</persName>, &amp; so came away from the camp.</p>
         <p>On my return to 
<placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName>, I immediately made preparations for our Swedish expedition.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="695" display="no">Herbert Gritten</persName> dined with me.  We protracted our converse until nearly midnight.</p>
