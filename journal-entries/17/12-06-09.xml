         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m.  There were 20 communicants.  A thunderstorm broke over Westminster about 10.30 a.m. and visibly affected the attendance at Mattins.  There were also many secessions to S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Paul's where the King &amp; Queen were announced to attend the service.  I preached from the word, 'I know their sorrows': the Offertory was over &#x00A3;110. which is &#x00A3;3. more than last year.</p>
         <p>I attended service in the Abbey at 3 p.m.  
<persName xml:id="2627"><hi rend="bold underline">Simpson</hi></persName> of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Paul's preached an eloquent but insolently Socialistic sermon from S. James ii.1 &amp; v.4.  He seemed to be inciting the Strikers to resist the police.</p>

<persName xml:id="82"><hi rend="bold underline">Marsden</hi></persName> preached in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at Evensong.  The Offertory amounted to nearly &#x00A3;17.  His sermon was simple but effective.</p>
