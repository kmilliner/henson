         <p>The cawing of rooks &amp; the singing of birds waked us early, but fatigued by our exertions overnight we did not get up for the early service.  We attended Mattins at 10.30 a.m.  The choir &#8211; 12 boys, &amp; 6 men &#8211; sang creditably, though their singing seemed unduly loud in the small space of the Choir.  The preacher &#8211; 
<persName xml:id="2638">Canon Denham</persName> &#8211; roared mightily in the pulpit, saying but little to compensate for the clamour.  After service we strolled down the main street, which is full of tablet&#8211;marked buildings much connected with Charles Dickens.</p>
         <p>At 2.45 there was a men's service in the Nave, at which I preached on Psalm 42.1 "As the hart desireth the waterbrooks &amp;c".  Partly owing, I think, to the thunderous weather, I preached slackly, &amp; with little effect, though the fine Norman Nave is acoustically very good, and my congregation were very attentive.  Evensong was at 4 p.m.  
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> attended, but I abstained.</p>
         <p>At 7 p.m. I preached on 'Jacob's Vision' to a very large congregation.  Then came dinner followed by some charming singing of old songs by 
<persName xml:id="2636">Miss Lane</persName>, &amp; then bed.</p>
