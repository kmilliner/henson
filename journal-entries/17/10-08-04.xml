         <p>I spent the forenoon in my study tearing up letters; then I signed 
<persName xml:id="170">Perkins'</persName> offertory accounts, and saw 
<persName xml:id="55">Knox</persName>.  Deciding to take the camera with us, I went to the Kodak shop by Charing Cross &amp; bought some films &#8211; 36 for 11/3.  After lunch we went to Waterloo &amp; caught the 2.50 p.m. train for <hi rend="bold underline">Bulford on Salisbury Plain, where we had arranged to visit </hi>
<persName xml:id="2354"><hi rend="bold underline">Major Oldfield</hi></persName>.  We changed trains at Salisbury, &amp; were met by the carriage at Bulford.  We arrived a few minutes before 6 p.m.</p>
         <p>This is an interesting old house built of flint with stone mullions to the windows, oak&#8211;panelled rooms, &amp; tiled roofs.  It stands hard by the church yard, &amp; is but a stone's cast from a little parish church.  The Rectory is close by, on the other side of the country&#8211;road.  The weather, which had been thunderous &amp; threatening, effected some slight self&#8211;reformation in the decline of the day: so that we could admire the quiet beauty of the rural scene.</p>
