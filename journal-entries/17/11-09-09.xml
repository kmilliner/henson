         </p>
         <p>Last night I wrote letters to the following:&#8211;</p>
         <list type="ordered">
            <item>
<persName xml:id="461">Aunt Long</persName>, for her Birthday.</item>
            <item>The 
<persName xml:id="1814">Dean of Worcester</persName>, declining to preach in the Cathedral</item>
            <item>
<persName xml:id="2453" display="no">Miss Grace Abbott</persName>, about her wedding in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName></item>
            <item>

         </list>
         <p>The more I reflect on the situation created by the recent episcopal appointments, &amp; by the revelation of official policy which they make, the more I am filled with consternation.  How is the critical issue raised by 
<persName xml:id="2238">Thompson's</persName> <ref xml:id="343">book</ref> to be dealt with by such as man as 
<persName xml:id="421">Russell&#8211;Wakefield</persName>?  We know already how 
<persName xml:id="49">Gore</persName> is prepared to deal with it.  The new Bishops, i.e. those who have been appointed since the d&#x00E9;bacle of 1906, are <hi rend="underline">all</hi> either Sacerdotalists, or "Socialists", or (the normal type) a blending of both.  Mostly they are men of no real character or influence in the church.  It is obvious that in a discussion on Thompson's book no effective part could be taken on the right side by any of them, for the simple &amp; sufficient reason that they neither know enough, nor care enough about the subject to be able to discuss it usefully or creditably.  They must perforce sit silent, &amp; listen to the sophistries of the "experts", Gore &amp; 
<persName xml:id="105">Talbot</persName>.  They either absent themselves from the debate, or take the prudent course of voting with the majority.</p>

         <div type="verse">
         <p>When, in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,</p>
         <p>I all alone beweep my outcast state,</p>
         <p>And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,</p>
         <p>And look upon myself, and curse my fate,</p>
         <p>Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</p>
         <p>Featured like him, like him with friends possest,</p>
         <p>Desiring this man's art &amp; that man's scope,</p>
         <p>With what I most enjoy contented least;</p>
         <p>Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising &#8211;</p>
         <p>Haply I think on THEE: and then my state,</p>
         <p>Like to the Lark at break of day arising</p>
         <p>From sullen earth, sings hymns at Heaven's gate; </p>
         <p>For THY sweet love rememb'red such wealth brings</p>
         <p>That then I scorn to change my state with Kings.</p>
         <p>Shakespeare. 146.<note xml:id="244" n="1"></note></p>
         </div>
         <p>When I went to get shaved, I fell in with some troops apparently returning from a march.  The men were very young, &amp; did not carry themselves well.  Moreover they were by no means remarkable physically.  They had the aspect of one of our weaker Territorial regiments.</p>
         <p>This morning the weather is hostile, a circumstance the more regrettable since we have arranged to go by steamer to Velamsund &amp; there to lunch with the 
<persName xml:id="717">
<persName xml:id="718">Kilmarnocks</persName></persName>, and see something more of 
<persName xml:id="1579">Spring&#8211;Rice</persName>.  It may possibly clear, but the steamer leaves at 11 a.m., &amp; now (9.30 a.m.) the outlook is evil.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[308]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The rain continuing with no prospect of improvement we cancelled our plan of lunching with the Kilmarnocks.  I wrote a letter to 
<persName xml:id="1261">Miss Violet Markham</persName>: &amp; then we went into a shop near the H&#x00F4;tel, &amp; bought some trifles for presents.<note xml:id="132" n="2"></note> Then we walked through the rain to the National Museum and spent the rest of the morning in the Historical Museum.  I began by leaning on the glass case to the exhibits, &amp; breaking it with a horrid crash.  A sum of 2 kr: was exacted by the attendant, or rather 1 kr. 75 &#x00F6;r.: but I munificently gave him the balance.  I have never seen such a magnificent collection of relics of the stone, bronze, &amp; iron ages.  The Viking gold is splendid.  There is also a very interesting collection of medieval objects; also some of historic &amp; artistic interest belonging to a more recent period.  Thus there is shown the general's baton used by Gustavus Adolphus at L&#x00FC;tzen; and a three&#8211;bladed dagger with which a monk once attempted to assassinate him.  After lunch, Lord Kilmarnock called, &amp; stayed some while.  Then, through a deluge of rain, we went out to the Grand H&#x00F4;tel Restaurant, &amp; had tea.  After returning to the H&#x00F4;tel Rydberg I wrote to 
<persName xml:id="1204">Mary Scott</persName>: sent a card to 
<persName xml:id="807">Helen Beeching</persName>: wrote also to 
<persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName>.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="2272" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Owen</persName> and his friend returned from Wisby [sic] full of enthusiasm for its walls, towers, &amp; churches.  They had suffered no hardships from the Baltic going &amp; coming: but their visit to Upsala [sic] was spoiled by rain.</p>
