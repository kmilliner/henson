         <p>Still the rain.  There was a rainless interval of about two hours in the forenoon, &amp; that we utilized by visiting quite a creditable waterfall on the moor.  A sheep waded &amp; swam across the burn just above the cataract.  This seemed a surprising performance, but everything is possible to a mountain sheep.  After lunch we left Garvocks, &amp; went to Artarman, Row, by way of the Clyde steamer from Greenock.  We passed quite close to a Brazilian battle&#8211;ship, and, when we arrived at Row, we found several destroyers lying in the river.  Everywhere are the signs &amp; tokens of naval war.</p>
