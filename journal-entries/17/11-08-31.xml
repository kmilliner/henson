         <p>A beautiful day, but a bite in the air foretells winter.  We began with the <hi rend="underline">Rosenborg Palace</hi>, 'an effective Renaissance edifice erected by Christian IV in 1610&#8211;25'.  It is full of treasures, some valuable, many curious, still more neither valuable nor curious.  A prettily planned garden surrounds the building.  Next, we visited the <hi rend="underline">Art Museum</hi>, which is filled with modern Danish Sculpture, &amp; Painting, the first wonderfully good, the last as wonderfully bad.  Mostly the native artists exhibit a 'corrupt following' of the corrupt model of the French.  But the statuary is very good indeed, immensely better than anything we produce in England.  After lunch we visited the <hi rend="underline">Vor&#8211;Frue&#8211;Kirke</hi>, &amp; looked at the Thorwaldseu statues &#8211; Christ &amp; the Apostles &#8211; standing round the Church.  After tea we went by Tram to <hi rend="underline">Fredericksberg&#8211;Have</hi>, &amp; saw a rather disappointing Zoo, set in an admirable Park.  After dinner I wrote to
