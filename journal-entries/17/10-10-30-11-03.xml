         <p>I celebrated in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m.  There were but 15 cts.</p>
         <p>At Mattins there was a large congregation including 
<persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName> &amp; his brother–in–law, 
<persName xml:id="2509" display="no">Moir</persName>. I preached an old sermon on the Right Use of possessions, a subject which fitted in with the unauthorized arrangement which makes this day, "Citizen Sunday."<note xml:id="153" n="1"></note></p>
         <p>In the afternoon Gilbert &amp; I walked 'Logic' across the Park.  
<persName xml:id="2510" display="no">Albert Steward</persName> was here, but remained on the sofa, having been rather badly kicked at football during the week.</p>
         <p>At Evensong the church was very full: I preached a dull sermon on "Law in Nature &amp; conscience".  But my words went over the heads of my congregation, &amp; wearied them in audience as me in delivery.  It is little use being abstract or argumentative with the multitude: besides I imagine there were some present who expected a political screed.</p>

<persName xml:id="571">Geordie</persName>,

<persName xml:id="206">Baddeley</persName>, Gilbert, besides 
<persName xml:id="1182" display="no">Miss Lister</persName> &amp; ourselves made up the party at supper.</p>

         <p>On Monday the 31<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> Oct: 1910, I celebrated the Holy Communion in my private Chapel for 
<persName xml:id="2284" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Barclay</persName>, who desired to receive the Holy Sacrament before going into a Nursing Home for an operation on his eyes.</p>
         <p>In the evening Miss Lister 'took' 
<persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName> &amp; me to the performance of 'Henry VIII' in His Majesty's Theatre.  It is a very splendid show: &amp; very good acting.  Henry VIII (
<persName xml:id="1854">Bourchier</persName>) was excellent: Wolsey (Beerbohm Tree) good, but not so good.  Queen Katherine declamatory &amp; unimpressive.  Anne Boleyn, natural &amp; effective.</p>
         <p>On Tuesday, the 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> of Nov:, I married 
<persName xml:id="2116" display="no">Millicent Cobbold</persName>, an innocent divorcée, to 
<persName xml:id="2117" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Anthony Babington</persName>.  Later in the day Ella &amp; I travelled to Oxford, where we were the guests of the

<placeName xml:id="49">Frewin Hall</placeName>.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">On All Souls Day I preached in the college chapel, taking as my text the words "The place whereon thou standest is holy ground."</hi>  <hi rend="italic">
<persName xml:id="130">Lang</persName> was present.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>We lunched with 
<persName xml:id="2511">Hutton</persName> at S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> John's: walked to Iffley along the river bank with 
<persName xml:id="2512" display="no">Ken</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="1170">A. L. Smith</persName>: &amp; had tea with 
<persName xml:id="302">Miss Anson</persName>.  I attended the Gaudy, where no less than 51 persons were present.<note xml:id="34" n="2"></note></p>
         <p>On Nov 3<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi> we returned to Westminster.</p>
