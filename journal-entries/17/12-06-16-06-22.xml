         <p>During the night rain fell heavily, but it cleared up about 8 a.m.  I celebrated in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's</orgName>.  There were 22 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>My sermon this morning is really the first draft of one of the Lectures which I intend to deliver to the Andover College Students.  Its theme is 'The Problem of Eccles<hi rend="superscript underline">l</hi> Unity'.  There was a large congregation, though there were vacant seats in the Parliamentary Benches.  The sermon was listened to with very close attention, but I fear the hungrier sheep were not fed by it.</p>
         <p>A Canadian clergyman named 
<persName xml:id="2630" display="no">Blagrave</persName> came to lunch, also

<persName xml:id="2632" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Potter</persName>, &amp; a lady whose name escapes me.  In the afternoon I wrote letters to 
<persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="1204">Mary</persName>.</p>
         <p>There was a very large congregation in the Nave of the Abbey Church at 7 p.m. when I preached on 2. Petter [sic] iii. '<hi rend="underline">We look for new Heavens, &amp; a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness</hi>'.  <hi rend="bold underline">I occupied for the first time the Jacobean pulpit which we have just substituted for the little old XV</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> century pulpit which we call Cranmer's.  The latter has a sounding board, which is lacking from the former, a circumstance which brings the acoustics into some uncertainty</hi>
<hi rend="bold">.</hi>  However I think everybody could hear.</p>

         <p>~~Men will never be cured of believing too little by unscrupulous attempts to involve them in believing too much.  Reason will never be effectually restrained from wandering into the vague &amp; doubtful, by unauthorised claims to settle every controversy by authority, &amp; to forbid the exercise of God's great gift of reason, as if to think for ourselves, and follow the dictates of conscience, were a sin.  It is well to note in history how these two evils, superstition &amp; infidelity, act &amp; react in strengthening each other.  Still, I cannot doubt that the most formidable of the two for us at present is infidelity.~~</p>

         <p>On Thursday, June 20<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1912, we dined with 
<persName xml:id="1330"><hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> George Macmillan</hi></persName>.  A very pleasant party.</p>
         <p>On Friday, June 21<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> 1912, I dined at Gray's Inn.  <hi rend="bold underline">After dinner I found myself beside </hi>
<persName xml:id="373"><hi rend="bold underline">Tim Healey</hi></persName>, who made himself most agreeable.</p>
         <p>There is an interesting custom at Gray's Inn, of which the origin is lost in antiquity.  Before dinner the Benchers &amp; their guests seat themselves on forms, &amp; are served with bread &amp; 'wine' (i.e. a decoction such as is used for 'loving&#8211;cups' &amp; for nothing else).</p>

He explained his failure to return the &#x00A3;<hi rend="doubleunderline">5</hi>. borrowed at Whitsuntide, &amp; displayed much concern at having displeased me.  We parted after an affectionate reconciliation.
