         <p>I celebrated at 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m.  There were 32 cts, including 
<persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName>.</p>
         <p>The Bishop of Stepney (
<persName xml:id="625">Paget</persName>) preached at Mattins in aid of the 
<orgName xml:id="145" display="no">East London Church Fund</orgName>. It was a good sermon. Afterwards he came in to lunch. An Indian, 
<persName xml:id="2147" display="no">Ramdas Khan</persName>, who brought me a very laudatory letter of introduction from the 
<persName xml:id="1565">Secretary of Yale</persName>, also lunched here. He was keenly interested in a discussion I had with the Bishop on matters ecclesiastical &amp; religious.</p>
         <p>The rain fell persistently during the afternoon, and the attenuated congregation at Evensong, attested the fact. I preached in aid of the E.L.C.F. from S. John 6.</p>
