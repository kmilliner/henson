<hi rend="bold">Trinity Sunday, May 22</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">nd</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1910.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A brilliant morning, &amp; not too hot.  I celebrated at 8 a.m. in St. Marg<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>, bethinking me of the service in Cuddesdon 23 years ago when I read the Gospel at my Ordination.  There were 18 cts.</p>
         <p>There was a very large congregation at Mattins.  This was the second time of reading that service, for we read it immediately after the early celebration of Holy Com<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi> in order to dispense ourselves legally from using the Athanasian Creed.  I did not <ref xml:id="623">preach</ref> again about the late King, thinking it well to keep to the subject of the Festival.  My text was S. Matt. XI.25–30.  The Offertory exceeded £21.  
<persName xml:id="2469">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Ross</persName> from Glasgow, &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2470" display="no">his wife</persName> were in Church.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I went with Gilbert &amp; Reggie to the 
<orgName xml:id="65">Leysian Mission</orgName>, and there addressed a body of about 500 men on "Christian Citizenship".</p>
         <p>At Evensong I preached again in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>.  The Church was crowded: the atmosphere stifling: the preacher weary.  In effect the sermon was a melancholy failure.  </p>
         <p>D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Ross, 
<persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="344">Sir H. Craik</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="1261">Miss Markham</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="1255">Linetta</persName>, Albert, &amp; Reggie came to supper.  I sustained the meal with difficulty, &amp; retired to bed immediately the guests had gone.</p>

         <p>On Friday, May 27<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1910, 
<persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName> &amp; I travelled to Winchester, &amp; stayed at the Deanery.  After dinner there was a meeting of the Sub. C<hi rend="superscript underline">tee</hi> for shortening the Litany &amp;c.  </p>
         <p>On Saturday we spent the morning in calling on 
<persName xml:id="1397" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Fearon</persName>, &amp; 
<persName xml:id="602">Burge</persName>.  With the last we found 
<persName xml:id="387">Wickham</persName>, the Dean of Lincoln.  Then we walked about the city.</p>
         <p><hi rend="underline">After lunch we moved on to Oxford, where we stayed with the </hi>
<persName xml:id="1170"><hi rend="underline">Master of Balliol</hi></persName>. The 
<persName xml:id="105">Bp. of Southwark</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="106">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Talbot</persName> were also there.  On Sunday (May 29<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>) we attended the Celebration at 8 a.m. in the College Chapel, &amp; received the Sacrament. Then we went to S. Mary's &amp; heard the Dean of Salisbury (
<persName xml:id="1332">Page–Roberts</persName>).  He delivered a highly rhetorical sermon of a now obsolete type.  <hi rend="bold underline">I was shocked to see ladies in the undergraduates' gallery</hi>.  
<persName xml:id="250">Watson</persName> was in church, &amp; took us to see his house in Christ Church.  </p>
         <p>We were entertained at lunch by 
<persName xml:id="41">Davis</persName> in the Balliol Common Room: 
<persName xml:id="2141">Oman</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2142">his wife</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="2143">Firth</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2144">his wife</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="251">Robertson</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="927" display="no">Miss Davis</persName> were the other guests.  Afterwards we called on 
<persName xml:id="403">Dicey</persName> with whom we found 
<persName xml:id="1204">Mary Scott</persName> radiant at having passed her final doctor's exam<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi>; Oman, where I was pleased to see my godson, 
<persName xml:id="1679">Charlie</persName>; &amp; 
<persName xml:id="302">Miss Anson</persName>, where we found 
<persName xml:id="2053">Sir Fred<hi rend="superscript underline">k</hi> Pollock</persName>.  By this time it was nearly time for service in chapel.  Here I <ref xml:id="624">preached</ref> to a pleasantly attentive company of young men.  The 
<persName xml:id="105">Bp.</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="106">his wife</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="107">daughter</persName> were also there: &amp; heard <hi rend="bold">[79] </hi>a sermon, which must have been extremely distasteful.  <hi rend="underline">For I thought well to make the associations of May 29</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="underline"> the theme of my discourse</hi>, <hi rend="bold underline">taking occasion to lament the Restoration settlement, &amp; call for another Oxford Movement to remedy the mischiefs of the last</hi>.<note xml:id="129" n="1"></note>  
<persName xml:id="1170"><hi rend="underline">A. L. Smith</hi></persName><hi rend="underline"> expressed his warm approval, &amp; so did Davis: but the Talbots maintained an eloquent silence</hi>.  I dined in Hall, and afterwards attended the concert there.  In common room I had much conversation with 
<persName xml:id="2473">Lindsay</persName>, the lecturer in philosophy, who is a son of 
<persName xml:id="2472">Principal Lindsay</persName>.  
<persName xml:id="210">Urquhart</persName> came in, &amp; was very friendly.</p>
         <p>On Monday, the 30<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> May, we returned to Westminster before lunch.</p>
         <p>On Thursday, June 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> 1910, I sent in a 'Memorandum' to the 
<orgName xml:id="176" display="no">Divorce Commission</orgName>, as the basis of examination on June 27<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>.</p>
         <p>On Friday 
<persName xml:id="2365">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Zabriski</persName> lunched here.</p>
