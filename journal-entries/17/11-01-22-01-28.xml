         <p>A cold raw morning darkening into a fog as the day advanced.</p>
         <p>I celebrated in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Marg<hi rend="superscript underline">t's</hi></orgName> at 8 a.m.  There were 14 cts.</p>
         <p>In spite of the bad weather there was a large congregation at Mattins.  I preached a 'new criticism' sermon on S. Mk. IV. 10&#8211;12 &amp; 33&#8211;34.  The Offertory exceeded &#x00A3;15.</p>

<persName xml:id="3413" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Macklin</persName> came to lunch.  During that meal the darkness became as that of midnight, though there was no fog.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="2066" display="no">Mary Rogers</persName> came to be prepared for Confirmation.</p>
         <p>I preached at Evensong to a moderate congregation, but found no comfort in the performance.</p>

         <p>On Thursday, Jan: 26<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1911, I celebrated the marriage of

<persName xml:id="2313" display="no"><hi rend="bold underline">Miss Chichester</hi></persName> in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>.  The same afternoon, 
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I went to Daglingworth near Chichester to visit 
<persName xml:id="2704" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Perceval</persName>.  On Friday, the 27<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Jan. we motored for most part of the day, seeing Malmesbury, of which the surviving fragment is extraordinarily full of interest.  The carved south&#8211;porch is a poor man's Bible in stone.  From the roof a fine view is obtained.  The slopes on which once grew the vines from which the monks manufactured Malmesey wine are pointed out.  The sexton said that he as a freeholder held in full ownership 3Â½ acres of the 800 acres which Athelstan presented to the folk of Malmesbury.  This land pays no rates &amp; taxes.  On Saturday, the 28<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Jan: I returned to town, leaving Ella at Daglingworth.<note xml:id="127" display="no" n="1"></note></p>
