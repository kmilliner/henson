         <p>We attended service in the parish church.  Mattins and Holy Communion without sermon.  There was a good congregation, &amp; a fair number of communicants.  The service reverent &amp; hearty.  I was more than commonly well pleased.  This pleasing impression, moreover, was not disallowed when I attended Evensong, and listened to a short, simple, &amp; suitable discourse by the Rector &#8211; 
<persName xml:id="2567">Tomson</persName>.  There was a considerable gathering of the village folk.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I read through (with divers skippings) the book called <ref xml:id="530">"A Japanese artist in London"</ref>.  It is extremely interesting &amp; also in important aspects illuminating.  The contrast between the treatment the Author received in San Francisco &amp; that he received in London is admirably described, and very agreeable to English vanity.</p>
