<persName xml:id="204"><hi rend="bold underline">Tom Tait's</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> death</hi>.  He seems to have been but a short time ill of meningitis.  I wrote a letter of condolence to 
<persName xml:id="1185">his father</persName> with a heavy heart.  Tom was about 19 years old, &amp; shaping for a worthy career in his father's profession.</p>
         <p>After lunch our hostess drove us into Aberfeldy; on the way we saw &amp; admired two old Scottish houses, Castle Menzies &amp; Grantully Castle.  We found the Episcopalian minister at Aberfeldy − 
<persName xml:id="2386" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Harrison</persName> − engaged in entertaining a party of London scouts.  Our hostess invited them to lunch tomorrow, &amp; then proceeded to make the requisite preparations.  We had tea in Aberfeldy, &amp; returned in a closed carriage through falling rain.</p>
