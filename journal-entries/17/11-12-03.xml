         <p>I must have contracted a chill last week for today I am bodily in poor case, a circumstance the more inconvenient since 
<persName xml:id="800">Westlake</persName> is on duty in the Abbey.  I celebrated in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Marg<hi rend="superscript underline">t's</hi></orgName> at 8 a.m. and administered without assistance to 21 communicants.</p>
         <p>At Mattins there was a fairly large congregation. I preached from Rom. xiii.12,13.  
<persName xml:id="2010">Compston</persName> celebrated; there were 88 communicants.  </p>
         <p>At Evensong the congregation did not appear to me large: but the offertory was quite equal to the average amount.  I preached again on the Epistle for the day.  After the Benediction we sang the 51<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> Psalm.</p>
