         <p>I prepared notes for my <hi rend="underline">Welsh</hi> speech in the evening: &amp; then attended a Chapter meeting.  We had an offer from the 
<orgName xml:id="203">Civil Engineers</orgName> to set up a window in memory of 
<persName xml:id="1387">Lord Kelvin</persName>.  In the afternoon, I travelled to Oxford, and dined with the 
<persName xml:id="2619">President of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> John's</persName>, together with the 
<persName xml:id="2146">Bp. of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> David's</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="205">Cunliffe</persName>.  We were all bound for the anti&#8211;Disestablishment Meeting in the Town&#8211;Hall.</p>
         <p>It was certainly a good meeting.  The President of S. John's &#8211; formerly a Welsh Dean &#8211; presided.  I moved, &amp; the Bp. of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> David's seconded, a resolution of protest, which was adopted with much enthusiasm.</p>
         <p>After the meeting I walked with 
<persName xml:id="117">Rashdall</persName> to his house, &amp; had some talk.</p>
