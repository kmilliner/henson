         <p>~~The value even of true Religion, though it be of an excellent nature &amp; kind, stands much in <hi rend="underline">the hopefulness &amp; improveableness of it</hi>: and is not so much to be considered in respect of what it is, <hi rend="underline">as what it shall come to</hi>.  This lank spiritless Religion as soon as you assume &amp; take it up, you know the best of it. 'Tis not of a growing thriving kind: never expect better of it. 'Tis true, the notional knowledge, opinionativeness, &amp; external observances, which we have spoken of, may be so increased, as an heap of sand may be: but the Religion of such grows not as a thing that hath life in it, by vital self&#8211;improvement.~~</p>

         <p>A very cold day yet not unwelcome after the slush &amp; fog of the last month.  I preached in the Abbey at the morning service, taking S. John xiii.14,15 as my text, &amp; Charles Gordon as my subject.  The collection was for the 'Gordon Boys Home': but only amounted to &#x00A3;32.0.0.  But the congregation was disappointingly small.</p>
