         <p>A bright forenoon inducted a wet afternoon.  We were taken to see the Highland games at Aberfeldie, but soon came away as there was small comfort in standing under persistent rain.  We had tea with two pleasant ladies named 
<persName xml:id="2475" display="no">
<persName xml:id="2476" display="no">Stuart&#8211;Robertson</persName></persName>, whose house joined hard by the sports&#8211;ground.</p>
         <p>The only letter which came to me was a lamentable one from 
<persName xml:id="1185">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Tait</persName>, telling me about 
<persName xml:id="204">Tom's</persName> sudden death.</p>
         <p>I finished a novel by 
<persName xml:id="2477">Charles Reade</persName>, <ref xml:id="403">'Put yourself in his place'</ref>.  It interested me by its vigorous description of the tyranny enforced by abominable outrage which marks the dominance of Trades&#8211;unionism.  In the generation which has passed since the novel was written, I do not think there has been any real improvement.</p>
