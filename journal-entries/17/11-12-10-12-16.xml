         <p>Another 'depression' came up during the night &amp; brought both a rising temperature &amp; a steady rain.  There were but 13 communicants in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> when I celebrated at 8 a.m.  
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> kept indoors on account of a bad cold.</p>
         <p>The congregation in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's was about half its normal size owing to the rain &amp; wind which [were] very violent.  The 
<persName xml:id="784">Speaker</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="1731">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Lowther</persName> were in their places: &amp; 
<persName xml:id="1261">Miss Markham</persName> brought her strange old 
<persName xml:id="2126">mother</persName>.</p>
         <p>Gilbert &amp; Reggie accompanied me in a taxi to the Congregational Chapel at Harringay, where, in spite of the heavy rain, a considerable company had come together to hear a lecture on 'Christianity &amp; Faith&#8211;Healing'.  I delivered the lecture, and returned immediately to 
<placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName>.</p>
         <p>At Evensong the congregation was hardly more than half its ordinary size.  The rain fell in torrents.  I preached with a view to the Confirmation.  </p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="67">Frank Capon</persName> brought 
<persName xml:id="2125" display="no">Lily Apps</persName>, his fianc&#x00E9;e, to see me.</p>

         <p>On Wednesday, the 13<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Dec: 1911, Ella &amp; I joined the 
<persName xml:id="128">Abp.</persName> at Victoria, &amp; travelled down to Canterbury, where we stayed as his guests at 'the Old Palace', a pleasant new house ingeniously dovetailed on to divers monastic ruins by 
<persName xml:id="648">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Car&#x00F6;e</persName>.  The Abp. &amp; I had a prolonged conversation on matters ecclesiastical.  </p>
         <p>The next morning we returned together to London.  
<persName xml:id="413">Reichel</persName> arrived after dinner, &amp; stayed till Saturday morning.  He is very cheerful, &amp; carries his bereavement with manliness.  I set him down to read <ref xml:id="391">"Fourteen Years a Jesuit"</ref>, which interested him vastly.</p>
         <p>My confirmation candidates will apparently number about 15 viz. 10 females &amp; 5 males.  The latter are a mixed lot.</p>
