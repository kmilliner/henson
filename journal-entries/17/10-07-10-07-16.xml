Chron. 21.1: the two accounts of David's numbering of Israel, referring the suggestion respectively to Jehovah &amp; to Satan.  My theme was <ref xml:id="626">'Religious Progress'</ref>, &amp; I illustrated it from this dramatic example of change in Jewish conceptions of Jehovah. The congregation was very attentive indeed. The Offertory was &#x00A3;21.19.9.</hi>

         <p>On Tuesday (July 12<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>) we travelled to Winchester.  There we were met by the 
<persName xml:id="1123">Bp of Southampton</persName>, and motored to Farnham Castle, where the 
<persName xml:id="325">Bishop of Winchester</persName> was giving a Garden party to all and sundry.  I admired the castle, over which the chaplain, 
<persName xml:id="2151">Fitzgerald</persName> conducted me.  The flower garden on the ruined keep was fascinating.  Bishop Ryle was not able to receive his guests, being prostrate with a vein in his ankle.  However he sent for me, and I had a short talk with him.  He seemed depressed.  Then we motored back to Basset.</p>
         <p>The next day (July 13<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>) we motored through the Forest to Lymington, from whence we crossed the Solent to Yarmouth, where another motor met us, &amp; took us to Ventnor.  Here the Bishop addressed a garden&#8211;meeting for the 
<orgName xml:id="177" display="no">Bishop&#8211;of&#8211;Winchester's Fund</orgName>, arriving late by consequence of a punctured tyre.  After the meeting we motored to Cowes, whence we crossed to the mainland, passing up Southampton Water.  The weather was perfect, &amp; the beauty of sea and land indescribable.</p>
         <p>On Thursday (July 14<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>) we returned to West<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi>.  I assisted the 
<persName xml:id="280">Bp. of Ripon</persName> in
