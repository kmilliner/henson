         <p>The day was fine but over&#8211;warm.  Thunder in the air made an oppression on one's spirits.  I did not get up until tea&#8211;time.  
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> read the Gospel, Epistle, &amp; Collect, the Psalms, &amp; 2= Lesson.  We strolled round the grounds.  I observed on one of the apple trees a luxuriant growth of mistletoe.  Rabbits abound.  I am told that about a thousand of them are annually shot on this property, &amp; sold in Manchester.</p>
         <p>In the course of the night there was a considerable thunderstorm accompanied by a deluge of rain.</p>
