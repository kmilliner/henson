<hi rend="bold">New Year's Day, Saturday, 1910.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's at 8 a.m.  There were 14 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>, including 
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>.  After breakfast I finished my sermon, and then went again to 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> to officiate at a wedding.  After service I walked to the printers to make sure that they had duly put in hand the papers for the Memorial Service. Then more sermonizing until lunch.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I preached in the Abbey on the subject of the Festival.</p>
         <p>Then I called on the 
<persName xml:id="109">Archdeacon</persName>, who seems very lonely &amp; frail: &amp; wrote to the 
<persName xml:id="128">Archbishop</persName> inviting him to take part in the service on Tuesday.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="659" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> C. G. May</persName>, 49 Lincoln's Inn Fields called on me to offer assistance in the Service.  He is the Duke's man of law.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="114">Welldon</persName> arrived about 6.30p.m.  He seems well &amp; in boisterous spirits.</p>
