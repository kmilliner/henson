<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I attended the breakfast of the 
<orgName xml:id="14" display="no">Church Service Society</orgName>, at which I presided &amp; made a speech of 20 minutes.  Then we went to S. Giles's, &amp; looked at the Church before going on to the Assembly Hall, where the great debate on Reunion was to begin.  I heard the speeches of 
<persName xml:id="1524">Norman M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Leod</persName>, and 
<persName xml:id="1140">Patterson</persName>, both excellent.  Then we came back to 39 Palmerston Place, lunched, took up my baggage, &amp; went on to the Railway Station, where we parted.  
<persName xml:id="491">Lady Frances Balfour</persName> was travelling in the same train: we had some speech together, after leaving Carlisle.</p>
         <p>The train ran in to Euston exactly to time &#8211; 10.45 p. m.  I reached home shortly after 11 p.m.: to find the house in confusion, &amp; everything smelling of wet paint.</p>
