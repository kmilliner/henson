         <p>~~"I am not, nor would be accounted willingly, Arminian, Calvinist, or Lutheran, (names of division) but a Christian.  For my faith was never taught by the doctrine of men.  I was not baptized into the belief, or assumed by grace into the family of any of these, or of the Pope . I will not pin my belief unto any man's slieve [sic], carry he his head never so high; not unto S. Augustine, or any ancient Father.  A Christian am I, &amp; so glory to be; only denominated of Christ Jesus, my Lord &amp; Master, by whom I was never yet so wronged, that I would relinquish willingly that royal title, &amp; exchange it for any of his menial servants."~~</p>
