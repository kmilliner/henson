         <p>I revised my sermon before breakfast: finished &amp; posted a letter to 
<persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName>: and gave Logic a run.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="539"><hi rend="bold underline">Alfred Lyttelton</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> sent me Sydney Smith's Works in 5 vols, together with a very kindly expressed letter thanking me for preparing </hi>
<persName xml:id="2065" display="no"><hi rend="bold underline">Mary</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> for Confirmation; 
<persName xml:id="1333">his wife</persName> also wrote very generously.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="126">Pryke</persName> preached a good sensible sermon: nowise original in thought or specially felicitous in expression: but pleasant to listen to, and giving one a good impression of the preacher.  There was but a poor congregation.  M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Pryke came to lunch.</p>
         <p>I preached to a large congregation in the afternoon, continuing my subject of last Sunday.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="2213">Arnold Judd</persName> came to consult me about his best course with respect to a theological college.</p>
         <p>
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> was crowded at Evensong.  In the congregation was the new Moderator of the Church of Scotland (
<persName xml:id="712">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Adam Muir</persName>).  Also 
<persName xml:id="2026">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Kelman</persName> of Free S. George's &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2212" display="no">his daughter</persName>.  They all came in to supper afterwards.</p>

         <p>On Monday, (April 11<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>) 
<persName xml:id="438">young M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Pryke</persName> lunched with me, &amp; had some conversation respecting his religious perplexities.  He appears to be an ingenuous young man, rather overwhelmed with the German criticism, &amp; nervously anxious to be Quixotically 'honest' as to his own beliefs.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I conducted a Funeral Service for 
<persName xml:id="2209">Sir W<hi rend="superscript underline">m</hi> Bonsfield</persName>.</p>
         <p>On Tuesday (April 12<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>) I lunched at Lambeth as one of a company of about 40 persons gathered by the 
<persName xml:id="128">Archbishop</persName> to meet 
<persName xml:id="2211" display="no">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Spieker</persName>, the Chairman of the 
<orgName xml:id="11" display="no">German Peace Association</orgName>.</p>
         <p>On Thursday afternoon I conducted a Funeral Service in S. Margaret's for 
<persName xml:id="2210">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> James Tomkinson</persName> M.P., who was killed in a steeple&#8211;chase last week.  There was a considerable muster of Members, including the 
<persName xml:id="215">Prime Minister</persName>, with whom I walked back to Downing Street afterwards.</p>
