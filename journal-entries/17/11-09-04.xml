         <p>The day was brilliantly fine, though a strong wind somewhat diminished our enjoyment of it.  The route at first lay through broad canals lined with trees: then a beautiful lake; &amp; then the Baltic crowded with wooded islands.  Finally Lake Malar, another dock, &amp; then Stockholm.  We finished our journey at 9 p.m.; having taken 57 hours in doing it.  We drove at once to the Rydberg, where we found a pile of letters awaiting our arrival.  From one of these I learn that the 
<persName xml:id="280">Bishop of Ripon</persName> has announced his resignation.  So there is yet another bishoprick to be filled.  It will be interesting to see how they <hi rend="underline">are</hi> filled (v.p.38)</p>

         <p>Assuredly the Obscurantists have made a good start.  With Gore at Oxford, working with

<persName xml:id="130">Lang</persName> at York, &amp;

<persName xml:id="128">Davidson</persName> at Lambeth to stand between himself &amp; a complete domination of the Bench, 'tis hard to see how their reign can be shaken.</p>
