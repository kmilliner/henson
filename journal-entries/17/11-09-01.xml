         </p>
         <p>We were horribly hustled in our departure, &amp; finally left with no more than an essay at breakfasting.  The day was cheerless, chilly, &amp; wet.  The steamer left at 8.15 a.m., &amp; took about 2 hours in crossing to Malmo.  We found no pleasure in the passage, for the sea was choppy, the rain fell steadily, &amp; the wind was violent.  However we survived, &amp; at Malmo found little difficulty in the Customs.  We were all day travelling to Gothenberg, and could get nothing to eat but some dubious buns &amp; chocolate.  But we made tea on the train, &amp; so got though the time well enough.  We arrived in Gothenberg at 6.35 p.m. &amp; at once proceeded to the <hi rend="underline">Grand H&#x00F4;tel Haglund</hi>, where we had supper.  I wrote to

         <p>The scenery on both sides of the line from Malmo to Gothenberg is flat &amp; uninteresting.  Under a cloudy sky &amp; falling rain, it was particularly uninviting.  As we approached our destination, there was an improvement in the weather.  The rain ceased, the sun shone out, &amp; the country became more varied.  So we were more cheerful &amp; satisfied at the end than at the start of the day.</p>
