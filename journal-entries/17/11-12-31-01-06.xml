         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m.  There were but 14 communicants, all women save three.</p>
         <p>The congregation at Mattins was fair.  I preached from the words "Little children, guard yourselves from idols".  Offertory amounted to &#x00A3;15.5.7.</p>
         <p>There was a very large congregation at Evensong.  I preached on "The transitory &amp; the eternal", taking as my text the two passages Isaiah 40.8: &amp; 1. John 2.17.  After service we sang four carols, &amp; the "Old hundredth".  The Offertory exceeded &#x00A3;9.</p>

         <p>The year 1911 cannot be considered as favourable to me.  An unprecedented amount of eccles<hi rend="superscript underline">l</hi> change has taken place, and I remain where I am.  The fact suffices to show the disposition of 'the powers that be' towards me: but its significance is enhanced by the appointments which have been made.  Moreover, it is impossible not to regard as very unfortunate from this point of view the filling up with relatively young men the two Metropolitan Deaneries, one or other of which might have seemed the natural terminus for me, if (as seems evident) I am regarded as 'impossible' for a bishoprick.  This must be held to be the case since Ripon has been disposed of.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">But truly we know not what is best for ourselves, &amp; our wisdom is to look well to our steps in the path wherein we are actually treading</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi>  The change of Deans here has made the situation pleasanter: &amp; I think a less evil report will go forth of the Deanery respecting me.  Possibly this circumstance may underlie the unprecedented course of the 
<persName xml:id="128">Archbishop</persName> in asking me to visit him at Canterbury, and talking over Church&#8211;affairs very freely &amp; confidentially.  
<persName xml:id="208">Beeching's</persName> departure removes my most intimate friend from the Chapter: &amp; 
<persName xml:id="296">Duckworth's</persName> death takes away a kind &amp; helpful person.  <hi rend="bold underline">As Sub&#8211;dean I succeed to a post which has marked the end of preferment to its holders for a century past</hi><hi rend="bold">!</hi>
