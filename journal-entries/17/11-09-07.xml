         <p>Truth fails not; but her outward forms that bear</p>
         <p>The longest date do melt like frosty rime,</p>

         <p>Of yesterday, which royally did wear</p>
         <p>His crown of weeds, but could not even sustain</p>
         <p>Some casual shout that broke the silent air,</p>
         <p>Or the unimaginable touch of Time.</p>

         <p>We made an expedition to Upsala [sic], where we inspected the fine Gothick Cathedral, saw the Gothick Bible of Ulphilas, and visited the pagan Sanctities at Gamla&#8211;Upsala.  The weather was favourable, &amp; even illustrated our drive to the famous Tumuli by a benignant Rainbow.  The students in their white caps are everywhere, dominating the little city with their presence.  They are a tall, frank, good&#8211;looking set of young men.</p>
