         <p>I attended the annual meeting of the 
<persName xml:id="35">West London Mission</persName> (Wesleyan Methodist) in the Queen's Hall.  
<persName xml:id="1307">Perks</persName> presided, &amp; made a blatant speech.  Then I spoke, taking occasion to speak about the 
<persName xml:id="475">Bishop of Hereford's</persName> Invitation to the Nonconformists to receive the Holy Communion in his Cathedral on Coronation Day.  I spoke very plainly to the 
<persName xml:id="105">Bishop of Winchester</persName>.  This part of my speech I had typed, and gave to the Reporters.  
<persName xml:id="323">Silvester Horne</persName> spoke: &amp; then the Missioner, 
<persName xml:id="2173">Rattenbury</persName>, who begged frantically: &amp; then his predecessor, 
<persName xml:id="347">Ensor Walters</persName>, who simply <hi rend="underline">roared</hi>.  The bellowing fervour of these men almost disconcerts me.  They are like Dervishes!  And the orgy of mutual compliment!!</p>
