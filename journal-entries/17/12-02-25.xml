         <p>~~Whereas preaching ought to be to no other end but for the gaining of souls, what shall we say to those that preach only for ostentation and to gain applause?  <hi rend="bold underline">Nay, what may we not say against such, who make a solemne prayer before Sermon, for the assistance of the holy Spirit of God in the delivery of the Word; and yet trust not at all to the assistance of God's Spirit but to their own wit &amp; eloquence, and come to declaim &amp; vent their neat compositions, in the study &amp; framing of which, they never sought God, nor sent up a prayer for direction?</hi>~~</p>

         <p>The Abbey Preacher, 
<persName xml:id="2137"><hi rend="bold underline">Edghill</hi></persName> from Southwark, had the temerity to arrive without vestments.  With 
<persName xml:id="1714" display="no">Weller's</persName> help I fitted him out with 
<persName xml:id="800">Westlake's</persName> surplice &amp; stole, &amp; 
<persName xml:id="636">Pearce's</persName> hood!  I preached in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's with infinite difficulty.  There was a fair but not a crowded congregation, including the 
<persName xml:id="784">Speaker</persName>.</p>
         <p>My sermon in the Abbey was delivered with a great effort.  There seemed to be a large congregation.</p>

         <p>I had some conversation with <hi rend="bold underline">Edgehill</hi>, from which I gathered that he is restless &amp; uncomfortable in his present situation, &amp; might be glad to come here as my colleague.  In some ways he would be very suitable.  He is certainly a student, &amp; would use well the comparatively large leisure of this curacy.  He says that he can sing the services, &amp; is accustomed to do so at Southwark Cathedral.</p>
