         <p>The glass falling, &amp; a rain&#8211;announcing wind gave an evil impression as I went to the early Communion.  There were 34 cts, &amp; would have been 35 had not one fainted, &amp; been carried out.</p>
         <p>About 10 a.m. it started to rain, &amp; my last hopes of a good Offertory vanished.</p>
         <p>There was a wretched congregation: I preached with a sinking heart: the offertory fell short of &#x00A3;35.  The least amount which will be necessary is &#x00A3;150!</p>
         <p>The evening congregation was not large, but it was relatively generous.  &#x00A3;23 was added to the fund.</p>
         <p>During the week I appealed by letter to the seatholders, &amp; received about &#x00A3;50.  </p>
         <p>By the end of the week, the Fund amounted to &#x00A3;111.14.6</p>
