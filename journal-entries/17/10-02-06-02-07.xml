         <p>On Monday, Feb: 7<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1910, I attended the meeting of the 
<orgName xml:id="10" display="no">Croydon Ministers' Association</orgName>.  It was held in the Vestry of the George Street Congregational Church, and consisted of 22 ministers of divers Nonconformist Bodies.  I spoke for about 35 or 40 minutes on "The Relation of the Established Church to Nonconformity".  The discussion was interesting.  One Congregationalist minister said that the <hi rend="bold underline">inadequate education of the Anglican clergy was to his mind the real stumbling block!!</hi>  Another with more reason asked, <hi rend="underline">which</hi> Church of England can we unite with, since there are at least two entirely opposed to each other?  A third speaker said briefly that in his experience the clergy of the Church of England were the main difficulty!  On the whole they were creditably self&#8211;restrained considering that I had told them some home truths of no flattering kind.  I gave them copies of my Lectures on the <ref xml:id="315">Lambeth Report</ref>, and of the Sermon on <ref xml:id="332">'Anglicanism &amp; Reunion'</ref>.</p>
         <p>I dined with the
