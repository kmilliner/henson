         <p>There were 21 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at 8 a.m.: &amp; 32 at 11 a.m.</p>
         <p>Congregations were very large both at Mattins &amp; at Evensong.  I preached twice, making my sermons rather briefer than usual in deference to the lengthening conditions of the day.  In the afternoon Gilbert &amp; I walked with "Logic" across Hyde Park.  The Offertories throughout the day reached the respectable amount of &#x00A3;25.17.1.  It is interesting to note that throughout Lent the Offertories have ranged from &#x00A3;22 to &#x00A3;28 every Sunday.  This is a substantial improvement from former years; I myself have been preacher twice every Sunday.</p>
