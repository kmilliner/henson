         <p>The Abbey was closed in order that preparations for the Coronation might be made.</p>
         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m. in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's.  There were 20 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">I travelled to Wolverhampton by the 11.50 a.m. express from Euston, in order to take part in 
<persName xml:id="253">Lord Wolverhampton's</persName> funeral</hi>.  
<persName xml:id="2312">Sir Charles Shaw</persName> motored me to the church, where, (and in the churchyard) a great multitude of people had assembled.  The 
<persName xml:id="381">Bishop of Lichfield</persName> took part of the service.  I read the Lesson in church, &amp; two prayers at the grave&#8211;side.  Immediately afterwards I returned to town in company with 
<persName xml:id="2478">Bonham&#8211;Carter</persName>, one of the 
<persName xml:id="215">Prime Minister's</persName> secretaries, who represented his chief at the funeral.</p>
         <p>I preached in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's at Evensong.</p>
         <p>N.B. 
<persName xml:id="1518" display="no">Whitton</persName>, who has been in our service for <hi rend="italic">more than five years, left us in order to get married.</hi>

         <p>On <hi rend="underline">Friday</hi>, March 3<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi>, I presided at an Intercollegiate Scholars debate at Hackney College, Hampstead.  
<persName xml:id="1520">Forsyth</persName> entertained me at dinner before the debate.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">On Saturday, March 4</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> the Abbey Choir came to 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>, &amp; there sang Evensong</hi>.  
<persName xml:id="2249">Robinson</persName> of All Hallows gave the Lenten lecture.  The 
<persName xml:id="296">Sub&#8211;dean</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="752">Barnett</persName>, &amp; I represented the Abbey.</p>
         <p>Afterwards I went to the 
<orgName xml:id="13" display="no">Psycho&#8211;Therapic committee</orgName>, where we examined &amp; listened to a doctor named 
<persName xml:id="2247" display="no">Durrant</persName>, who has been associated for the last 18 mos. with 
<persName xml:id="2248" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Hickson</persName>, more closely than he imagined.  
<persName xml:id="706">Sir Dyce Duckworth</persName> 'put the fear of the Lord into him', by an ominous reference to the view the Medical Council would probably take of his connection with an 'unqualified practitioner'.</p>
