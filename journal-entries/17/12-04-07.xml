         <p>I celebrated in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m.  There were 115 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.  Of the newly&#8211;confirmed I observed 
<persName xml:id="1686" display="no">Clay</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="1665">Norman Box</persName>, and several girls.  But the number is rather disappointing.</p>
         <p>There was a large congregation at 11 a.m. when the Eucharist was celebrated &#8211; 
<persName xml:id="2010">Compston</persName> sang &#8211; &amp; there were 235.  I <ref xml:id="618">preached</ref> from 1. Cor: XV.58.  A collection was made for the sufferers from the Coal Strike.</p>
         <p>I went to Evensong in the Abbey.  There were innovations &#8211; a procession thro' the cloisters, &amp; round the ambulatory, &amp; a final prayer with bowings at the end of the nave.  <hi rend="bold underline">I felt sufficiently perturbed by all this to write to the

         </p>
         <p>S. Margaret's was very full at Evensong.  I preached on Colossians iii.1.  The collections throughout the day were given to the 
<orgName xml:id="172" display="no">Strike Relief Fund</orgName>.  They amounted to &#x00A3;<hi rend="doubleunderline">81.13.0</hi>.</p>
