<persName xml:id="55">Knox</persName> celebrated at 8 a.m.  There were 30 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>. At Mattins the congregation was fairly large, but it was restless, and there were absent some familiar faces.  
<persName xml:id="990">Runciman</persName> was present.  I preached with difficulty by reason of a bad cold &amp; a desire to cough.  My text was taken from the Epistle for the day, "Jerusalem which is above is free; which is our mother".  Afterwards I celebrated: there were 90 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>I did not attempt my lecture at the 
<orgName xml:id="65">Leysian Mission</orgName>, on account of my cold.</p>
