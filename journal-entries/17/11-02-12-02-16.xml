<hi rend="bold">Septuagesima, February 12</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1911.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A beautiful morning.  I celebrated at 8 a.m. in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Marg<hi rend="superscript underline">t's</hi>.</orgName>  There were 15 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.  Then, after breakfast, I walked along the Embankment to the 
<orgName xml:id="79">Temple</orgName>, enjoying the sunshine &amp; the river &amp; the unaccustomed beauty of everything.  There was a large congregation: which listened very quietly to a sermon on the words of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Paul "They do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we are incorruptible."</p>
         <p>After service I lunched with the Benchers of the 
<orgName xml:id="49" display="no">Inner Temple</orgName>: &amp; took in a pretty young lady named 
<persName xml:id="2520">Bosanquet</persName>.  
<persName xml:id="889">Birrell</persName> was there, plump &amp; amiable.</p>
         <p>At Evensong I preached in S. Margaret's to a large congregation.  It was an old sermon which has appeared in print in the volume called <ref xml:id="13">'Preaching to the Times'.</ref>  
<persName xml:id="344">Craik</persName> was evidently restive under it, and dealt with me plainly after service!  He is a good fellow at bottom, &amp; so I take no offence: but his prejudices are unmanageable.</p>

         <p>This week has been drearily wasted by the sessions of 
<orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName>.  My attendance was intermittent, for on Wednesday, the <hi rend="bold underline">15</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold underline">, I went to Sutton, and performed the marriage ceremony for 
<persName xml:id="2075">Cissy Rawle</persName></hi>.  Prayer&#8211;book Revision, cut short by the Dissolution, makes another feeble start.  We carried a few amendments of the Rubricks of the Communion Office.</p>
         <p>On Thursday, the 16<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Feb; there was an election to the Poetry Professorship at Oxford.  
<persName xml:id="2521">Warren</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName> were candidates.  The former was elected by 174 votes to 147.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">The death of 
<persName xml:id="568">Eustace Balfour</persName> was announced in the 'Times' on Wednesday: &amp; by an unfortunate mischance, 'Punch' appeared with a cartoon representing 
<persName xml:id="508">Arthur</persName> as principal mourner beside the gravestone of Tariff Reform.  The 
<persName xml:id="2522">Editor</persName> of Punch sent a letter of explanation &amp; regret to the Times.</hi>
