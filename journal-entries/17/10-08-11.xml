         <p>Weather still fine, but declining as the day advanced.  I photographed the 
<persName xml:id="836" display="no">children</persName> after breakfast, &amp; then wrote some letters.  At noon 
<persName xml:id="227">Murray</persName> motored us to Langholm, where we lunched with 
<persName xml:id="2303" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Scott&#8211;Elliott.</persName>  Afterwards we returned home by another route, going into England &amp; returning by way of Gretna Green.  We had tea with 
<persName xml:id="2304" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Graham</persName>, our host's cousin, and then went through Ecclefechan, where we stopped to look at 
<persName xml:id="495">Carlyle's</persName> house.  Here I photographed some shoeless boys sitting on the parapet of the stone bridge in front of the house.  We reached 
<placeName xml:id="19">Murraythwaite</placeName> about 6 p.m.</p>
         <p>

<persName xml:id="2306" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Reid</persName> came to dine &amp; stay the night.  He is the nephew of 
<persName xml:id="1364">Lord Loreburn</persName>, and a very pleasant fellow.  After dinner we talked with our host on Fiscal Reform, until midnight.  He agrees with me in holding to Free Trade: and we pressed Murray somewhat closely on the South African situation, but our host's convictions do credit to the educational methods of party.  He is proof against all attack.</p>
