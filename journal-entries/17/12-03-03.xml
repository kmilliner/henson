         <p>~~"The reason why hypocrites boast of the works of the first Table, which are adoration &amp; duty towards God, is double, both because such works have a greater pomp &amp; demonstration of holiness, &amp; also, <hi rend="underline">because they do less cross their affections &amp; desires</hi>.  The Apostle takes this way to convict hypocrites, by sending them from the works of sacrifice to the works of mercy, which are the works of distinction, whereby to find out hypocrites, according to that of the Apostle, Pure Religion &amp; undefiled with God the Father is this; to visit the fatherless &amp; widows in their afflictions."~~</p>
