<hi rend="bold">Thursday, August 10</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1911.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A brisk wind sprang up about 2 a.m. which made me gather my blankets about me.  I finished a letter to 
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, &amp; wrote <ref xml:id="531">a short note</ref> to the 'Times' correcting the statement about men being bowled over by the heat.</p>
         <p>I accompanied one half of the Battalion on a little sham&#8211;fighting expedition, walking with 
<persName xml:id="2568" display="no">Capt<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi> Chew</persName>, one of the umpires.  The others were 
<persName xml:id="2569" display="no">Capt<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi> Kirby</persName> and 
<persName xml:id="2570" display="no">Major Brett</persName>, the last on horse&#8211;back.  We returned to camp about 2.30 entirely fit for lunch.</p>
         <p>I dined with 
<persName xml:id="367">Archie Parker&#8211;Smith</persName> in the 
<orgName xml:id="209">London Scottish</orgName> mess: and afterwards went with our own officers to the grand tattoo given by the 
<orgName xml:id="92">Territorials</orgName> for the benefit of the Dover charities.  The weather had now become very chilly: &amp; I had need of my mackintosh <hi rend="underline">for warmth</hi>.  We got back to camp about 11 p.m.</p>
