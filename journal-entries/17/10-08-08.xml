         </p>
         <p>We packed, breakfasted, &amp; went away under a leaden ungracious sky.  The train from Salisbury was express, &amp; stopped nowhere, bringing us in to Waterloo well to time.  We were home by 11.15 a.m.  <hi rend="bold underline">Here we were riotously welcomed by Logic, &amp; more decorously by 
<persName xml:id="1255">Linetta</persName> and 
<persName xml:id="1518" display="no">Whitton</persName></hi>.  I wrote such letters as needed answer, and sent off the annual cheque for my life assurance.</p>
         <p>Then we lunched rather hastily, &amp; were hustled off to Euston, where we caught the 2 p.m. express to Carlisle.  The journey was uneventful &amp; not uncomfortable.  At Carlisle we changed trains, &amp; came on to Dalston where the 
<persName xml:id="720">Bishop's</persName> carriage met us.  So we arrived at 
<placeName xml:id="48">Rose Castle</placeName> about 9.30 p.m., &amp; were kindly received by the Bishop &amp; his 
<persName xml:id="2298">family</persName>.</p>
