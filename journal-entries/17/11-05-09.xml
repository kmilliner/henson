         <p>I attended a meeting of the 
<orgName xml:id="180">Colonial Church Society</orgName>, a congregationalist venture.  The 
<persName xml:id="2206">Lord Mayor</persName>, a large facetious man immensely enjoying his pomp, presided.  I made a speech which was very well received.  The Egyptian Hall was crowded, great part of the audience being compelled to stand.  <hi rend="underline">We</hi> can't get such meetings, though we stack the platform with bishops &amp; peers!!</p>
