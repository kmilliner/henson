         <p>I called on the 
<persName xml:id="325">Dean</persName> and had a short conversation.  He was very glum, not having yet surmounted his resentment at being so summarily snuffed out in 
<orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName> at my insistence.</p>
         <p>We went to the Bank opposite the Cathedral gate, &amp; were shown the plate &#8211; six communion cups of 1632 &#8211; belonging to the Huguenot Church.  The Bank manager,

In spite of the drought, the country had a very luxuriant aspect, the wheat crops standing ripe for the scythe.</p>
