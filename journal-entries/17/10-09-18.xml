         <p>A bright morning.  I lay in bed for an hour after being called, &amp; read Lecky's History of Rationalism.  It is melancholy reading for a clergyman.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="91">Swallow</persName> preached at the morning service.  He succeeded in interesting the congregation by a rather lengthy sermon on the general subject of Woman's duty.  He said many sound things but was too <hi rend="underline">topical</hi>.  I Celebrated the Holy Communion.  There were about 100 communicants.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon there was a very large congregation which included 
<persName xml:id="539">Alfred Lyttelton</persName>.  I preached on the words "We walk by faith, not by sight."</p>
         <p>In the evening the Abbey was thronged, many standing in both transepts.  I <ref xml:id="628">preached</ref> on "The earth is the Lord's &amp; the fullness there of".</p>
