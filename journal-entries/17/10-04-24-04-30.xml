<hi rend="bold">4</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold"> Sunday after Easter, April 24</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1910.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I celebrated at the 10 a.m. service, as the 
<persName xml:id="44">Dean</persName> failed to keep tryst. 
<persName xml:id="1019">Addis</persName> preached a really excellent sermon to a large congregation, in which 
<persName xml:id="1211">George Russell</persName> was prominent.  In the afternoon I preached on S. James I.19, 20.  There was a large congregation, but overmuch petticoated.</p>
         <p>In the evening the Abbey was very full.  I preached again the sermon on <ref xml:id="402">'A Law of Liberty'</ref>, which has already appeared in print as part of the contents of the volume <ref xml:id="81">'Westminster Sermons'</ref>.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="1261">Miss Markham</persName> came to supper.  She is more full than ever of social&#8211;reforming enthusiasm, &amp; finds me rather a wet blanket.</p>
         <p>On Monday, the 25<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> of April, the C.C.C. met here.  Old 
<persName xml:id="2420">Prof. Mayor</persName> of S. John's Cambridge talked endlessly of his reminiscences.  These were not in themselves uninteresting, but they were quite irrelevant to the subject under discussion, and protracted to an intolerable length.  Afterwards, 
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I attended a reception at 47 Cadogan Place to see 
<persName xml:id="2418">Mary Bruce's</persName> wedding presents.</p>

         <p>On Tuesday, April 26<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, 
<persName xml:id="250">Watson</persName> and I dined with 
<persName xml:id="923">Newsome</persName>.  
<persName xml:id="552"><hi rend="bold underline">Headlam</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> was there, &amp; made himself abominably rude to me</hi>.  
<orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName> sate from Tuesday to Friday. Watson attended as Proctor for the Ch.Ch. Chapter, &amp; stayed with me.  On Tuesday, Wednesday, &amp; Thursday we had luncheon parties.  On Thursday there was a lively debate on the resolutions proposed by the 
<orgName xml:id="196">Marriage Law C<hi rend="superscript underline">tee</hi></orgName>.  The Report, on which these resolutions was based, was an extravagant document, written, as I judge, by 
<persName xml:id="2422">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> E. Wood</persName> the canonist, who has come into Convocation in succession to 
<persName xml:id="2421" display="no">D. Ayles</persName>.  I spoke with energy against the resolutions, one of which was withdrawn, &amp; another conditioned by a rider at my instance.  On the whole I think the Fanaticks had rather a bad time.</p>
         <p>On Friday, 
<persName xml:id="55">Knox</persName> came to tell me that he was ordered to bed for a week.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">On Saturday, I married </hi>
