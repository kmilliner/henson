<hi rend="bold">2</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">nd</hi><hi rend="bold"> Sunday after Easter, April 21</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">st</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1912.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The brilliant weather continues, &amp; has become very warm.  I celebrated at 8 a.m. when there were 23 communicants.  The services necessarily took the form of memorials for the unparalleled ship–wreck.  <hi rend="bold underline">It is just a week since the Titanic was sent to the bottom of the Atlantic by collision with an iceberg, no less than 1635 lives being lost</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi>  The newspapers have been filled with heart–rending narrations, which include many incidents of genuine heroism.  I preached twice in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>, the church being thronged.  Over £100 was collected for the 
<orgName xml:id="91" display="no">Lord Mayor's Fund</orgName>.  The 'Dead March' was played after service.</p>
         <p>As I strolled with 
<persName xml:id="1204">Mary Scott</persName> &amp; Logic in the Victoria Gardens, I observed on one of the seats a lad reading a paper.  We got into conversation, &amp; I learned that his name was 
<persName xml:id="2078" display="no"><hi rend="bold underline">Wilfrid Cyril Molloy</hi></persName>, that he was not yet 16 years old, that he had been out of work for some weeks, &amp; had spent the night on the Embankment.  I brought him to the house, entertained him during the day, &amp; housed him during the night.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[414]</hi> [sic]</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">My interesting young 'Find' turned out to be a shameless young liar</hi>.  He stayed here until Wednesday morning when he was 'recovered' by 
<persName xml:id="2079" display="no">his mother</persName>, a decent–looking, gentle mannered woman.  <hi rend="bold underline">On Tuesday I had expended £3. on providing him with clothes, which 
<persName xml:id="2111" display="no"><hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">rs</hi> Benny</persName></hi><hi rend="bold underline"> obtained for him</hi>.  I wrote (1) to the clergyman who had prepared him for confirmation, (2) to the 'Economic Society' where he said he had been employed, (3) to the woman, with whom he said he had lodged, (4) to the School–master, under whom he had been educated (5) to the Superintendent of the local police.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">The letters were favourable to the lad, but proved him to be a wonderful expert in 'terminological inexactitudes'</hi>.  His mother told me that the lad's 
<persName xml:id="2080" display="no">father</persName> had become an Agnostic, &amp; that this circumstance had caused much unhappiness in the house.</p>
         <p>On Wednesday afternoon, the 24<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> April, we went to Birchington: &amp; the next day we lunched with the 
<persName xml:id="4066">local Rector</persName>.</p>
         <p>On Friday morning I returned to Westminster &amp; at noon <hi rend="bold underline">conducted a Memorial Service in S</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">t</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Margaret's for </hi>
<persName xml:id="2082"><hi rend="bold underline"> Howard Brown Case</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> &amp; the others who were drowned in the shipwreck.  This service was arranged by the Society of Americans resident in London: &amp; was very largely attended by the colony. The </hi>
<persName xml:id="849"><hi rend="bold underline"> American Ambassador</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline">  sate in the </hi>
<persName xml:id="784"><hi rend="bold underline"> Speaker's</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline">  seat</hi>.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold">[416]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>On Saturday morning I travelled again to Birchington, &amp; that same afternoon we drove to Grove Ferry, &amp; there had tea in a Hotel over–looking the Stour.</p>
         <p>On Sunday, the 28<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> April 1912, I preached twice in the parish Church, &amp; celebrated the Holy Communion.  There were but meagre congregations, &amp; I received the impression of a dead–alive parish.</p>
         <p>On Monday, the 29<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> April, we returned to Westminster: at Victoria I bought a copy of <ref xml:id="393">'Vanity Fair'</ref>, which contains a most villainous caricature of me.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="1565"><hi rend="bold underline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> Anson Phelps Stokes</hi></persName> who is in Europe keeping his 'Sabbatic year' lunched with us.</p>
         <p>
<orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName> met on Tuesday, Wednesday, &amp; Thursday this week.  I attended &amp; made a speech on the Welsh Church Bill which was admired far beyond its merits.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">On Thursday, the 2</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">nd</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> of May, I was "raised" to the grade of a Master Mason</hi>.  There was a parade of ludicrous solemnities, which struck me with much wonder at the gratuitous foolishness of mankind.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="1135"><hi rend="bold underline">Mitford Mitchell</hi></persName> dined here the same evening.</p>
         <p>On Friday evening, the 3<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi> of May, I dined with 
<persName xml:id="601"><hi rend="bold underline">Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie</hi></persName>.  The other guests were
