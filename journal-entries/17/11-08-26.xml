<hi rend="bold">Saturday, August 26</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1911. Travelling from Amsterdam to Hamburg.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>We left Amsterdam by the 8 a.m.: and reached Hamburg at 5.4 p.m. but when we crossed the frontier we deleted an hour.  We had the Mittag&#8211;essen on the train comfortably enough: and for most of the journey a carriage to ourselves.  There was no difficulty at the custom house, but we had to unlock all our luggage.</p>
         <p>The thatch&#8211;covered ricks of corn have a picturesque appearance, &amp; form a characteristic feature of the scenery in Holland.  Add the canals &amp; windmills, &amp; <hi rend="underline">the sails of the boats in the canals</hi>, which have a surprising effect as they rise irrelevantly from the meadows, and you have the essentials of a typical Dutch landscape.</p>
         <p>Arriving in Hamburgh [sic] we recovered our baggage, and went to the <hi rend="underline">Kron Prinz Hotel</hi>, which adjoins the Haupt&#8211;bahnhof conveniently enough, though not itself on a palatial scale.  We took a walk in the town before dinner, but were speedily overtaken by the rain.  It was but a passing storm, yet it gave assurance that the settled weather had reached its term; &amp; that for the future we must make our count with the normal chances of travellers.</p>
