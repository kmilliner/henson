         <p>My umbrella was recovered by the gardener's small boy, who found it hard by the 'wishing stone'.  The morning was brilliantly fine, but it was no true indication of the day, which deteriorated quickly, and ended in a night of heavy rain.  We left Pitnacree by the early train, and arrived in Glasgow in easy time for the 2.38 p.m. train from Queen Street Station (execrable hole!) to Broomhouse, where we were met by the carriage &amp; driven to Daldowie, a fine old house surrounded by long avenues of beech trees, and bordered by the Clyde, now turgid &amp; swollen by the summer rains.  Our hostess, 
<persName xml:id="2316" display="no">Miss M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Call</persName>, and her niece, 
<persName xml:id="2315" display="no">Miss Maxwell</persName>, received us very kindly.  After tea we were taken to see the gardens, and live&#8211;stock âˆ’ cows, horses, pigs, poultry of every kind, dogs, &amp; cats &#8211; all the constituent factors of country life: </p>
         <p>The Episcopalian minister, 
<persName xml:id="2317" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Sinton</persName>, came to dinner.  
<persName xml:id="367">Archie Parker&#8211;Smith</persName> also is staying in the house.</p>
