         <p>I celebrated in the Abbey at 10 a.m.  
<persName xml:id="117">Rashdall</persName> preached, evidently rehearsing the substance of his evidence on Divorce.  <hi rend="bold underline">Thus stood together the two men whom the hopes &amp; fears of rival factions have already nominated to the vacant appointments, &amp; who will, almost certainly, not be appointed!</hi>
         </p>
         <p>There was a fair congregation in the Abbey in the afternoon.  I preached on "Repentance": taking as my text 2. Cor: VII. 10.</p>
         <p>At the 
<persName xml:id="44">Dean's</persName> request I went in to the evening service.  
<persName xml:id="2514">Gillson</persName> preached a conventionally good little Advent sermon.  His delivery is curiously redolent of 
<persName xml:id="49">Gore</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="105">Talbot</persName>.</p>
         <p>My spirits have sunk: &amp; I reach the end of this day in a profound depression.  Why is this? The damp, languid weather may account for something, but hardly for this restless heart&#8211;ache.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="2515" display="no">Young Walpole</persName> came in to supper.  He seems an amiable youth &amp; well&#8211;mannered.</p>
