         <p>We came away from Spencer Grange, Yeldham, with regret for its rustic beauty &amp; repose, with appreciation for its hospitality, &amp; with compassion for its affliction.  In spite of the Bank Holiday we travelled easily, &amp; reached 
<placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName> in excellent time for lunch.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">A very ill&#8211;natured attack on me under pretence of a <ref xml:id="395" display="no">review</ref> of <ref xml:id="383">"The Road to Unity"</ref> appears in the 'Church Quarterly'.  It is evidently written by 
<persName xml:id="552">Arthur Headlam</persName> himself, &amp; will no doubt give great satisfaction</hi>.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="1204">Mary Scott</persName> came to dinner.  Afterwards she and I walked 'Logic' round the yard, &amp; in the Chapter Garden, holding much intimate &amp; pleasant converse.  Then we rejoined 
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> indoors, and planned the course of our expedition into Sweden.</p>
