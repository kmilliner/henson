         <p>The weather had become close &amp; warm, making both preaching &amp; hearing wearisome.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="432">Papillon</persName> preached in the Abbey in the forenoon, well but discursively.  I celebrated.</p>
         <p>At lunch came Papillon &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2448">his wife</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="117">Rashdall</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="992" display="no">his wife</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="1267" display="no">Griffiths</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="1268" display="no">his wife</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="2449" display="no">Alice Edith Parker</persName>, &amp; Gilbert.</p>
         <p>There was a good congregation in the Abbey at 3 p.m. when I preached from Acts IV. 32, the first of two sermons on the thesis, 'How far does Christianity give us direct guidance with respect to these political, social, &amp; economical questions, which now confront us with menacing insistence?'  I confined myself to a discussion of the supposed Communism of the Apostolic Church.</p>
         <p>At 7 p.m. I went again to the Abbey, &amp; heard a very fair sermon from 
<persName xml:id="2450">Malden</persName>, the new Principal of the Leed's [sic] Clergy School.  He was formerly one of the lodgers at the Deanery.</p>
