         <p>~~We deal with ourselves just as the cheating empiric did with his patient, when he prescribed him this infallible remedy for all diseases, viz. a dose of the grand elixir in the yolk of a phoenix's egg, i.e. referred him to a medicine which was nowhere to be found.  Thus we promise ourselves, &amp; compound in our own imaginations a happiness that will arise out of such enjoyments.  We prescribe ourselves a task of acquiring those goods, &amp; conclude we shall be cured of all our wants: but alas! this is as mere a chimaera as that I spoke of.  We can never make things meet together just as we desire them: they will not conspire &amp; unite in such a fashion as we would have them to please us &amp; give us satisfaction.~~</p>
