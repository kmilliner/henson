         <p>A wet disconcerting day. Only 14 c<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>.  On this day 21 years ago, I was instituted to the Vicarage of Barking. May God for Christ's sake forgive the sins which have hindered, and the blunders which have defeated my Ministry! I am far more perplexed today than then, and I was a troubled man then. On the following Monday (Dec: 3<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi> 1888) I preached for the first time in the Abbey, a special sermon for Advent.</p>
         <p>At Mattins the congregation was rather meagre, and the coughing really disabling. I preached from the Gospel, "Who is this?" <hi rend="bold underline">taking up my parable against the new Theologian's alternative, "Jesus or Christ?</hi>
<hi rend="bold">"</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic">In the afternoon I went to Bethnal Green, &amp; addressed about 500 men in the 
<placeName xml:id="8">Excelsior Hall</placeName>.  My remarks were disconnected enough, for I read them bits of my American Journal, and moralized on the way.  However, they seemed to like it. </hi>
         </p>
         <p>The church was wellâ€“filled at Evensong. I preached from Isaiah II.3 "Out of Zion shall go forth the law, &amp; the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem".  We sang the "Dies Irae" after service.</p>

         <p>On Monday, Nov: 29<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1909, I went to Chigwell, and <hi rend="bold underline">lectured for an hour to the boys on "The Yellowstone Park"</hi>, illustrating my lecture with the 21 slides I purchased some weeks ago.

         <p>On Tuesday, Nov: 30<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1909, I dined with

<persName xml:id="2060">Sir James Dewar</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="261" display="no">Major Ronald Rosen</persName>. As Sir John &amp; I drove back to 
<placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName> we noticed a great force of police in Trafalgar Square keeping back a very demure crowd gathered to hear the result of the voting on the Budget.
