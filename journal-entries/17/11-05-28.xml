         <p>I started the day with a head ache which greatly incommoded me until evening, when it passed away.</p>
         <p>At 11 a.m. I preached in Old Grey Friars Church, a hideous structure, &amp; very bad acoustically.  There was a large congregation.  My text was I. Cor. XII. 31. 'But desire earnestly the greater gifts, &amp; a still more excellent way show I unto you.'  The minister, 
<persName xml:id="2439" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Grant</persName>, professed himself a great student of my writings.</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">At 3 p.m. I delivered the <ref xml:id="376">"Robert Lee"</ref> Lecture in S. Giles's Cathedral.</hi>  There was a considerable congregation including many members of the Assembly.  
<persName xml:id="2025">Lord Guthrie</persName> was there, &amp; 
<persName xml:id="491">Lady Frances Balfour</persName>.  I spoke for exactly one hour.</p>
         <p>At 6.30 p.m. the Iron Church was thronged, many being turned away from the doors.  
<persName xml:id="566">Fleming</persName> read the lessons: and 
<persName xml:id="2440">Wallace</persName>, the minister of the Parish, conducted the service.  I preached from Acts IX.1, 2: speaking of Christianity as "The Way" of true human living.</p>
         <p>After service Fleming entertained me &amp; some others at supper in the
