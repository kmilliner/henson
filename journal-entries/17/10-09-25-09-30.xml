         <p>A dull depressing day, warm &amp; close, deadly to work in.  
<persName xml:id="216">Gow</persName> preached a vigorous, sensible sermon on "Christian contentment", in which he gave no quarter to the passive&#8211;obedience folks.  It was delightful to see the 
<orgName xml:id="178">King's Scholars</orgName> come up for Communion.  Those rows of kneeling boys move me wonderfully.</p>
         <p>At 3 p.m. there was a large congregation, including the 
<persName xml:id="128">Archbishop of Canterbury</persName>, looking very vigorous after his holiday.  I preached on <ref xml:id="629">"The Christian Ministry"</ref>, arguing strongly against the sacerdotal conception of the ministry.  The 
<persName xml:id="296">Sub&#8211;Dean</persName> told me that this was the anniversary of his own Ordination, fifty two years ago.</p>
         <p>I preached at Evensong in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> to a very large congregation.  The subject of my sermon was the 'broadness' of the Divine Law.  I took my text from the Psalm 119. 96. "I see that all things come to an end, but Thy commandment is exceeding broad".  The Offertory amounted to the unusually large sum of &#x00A3;9.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="62">Kirshbaum</persName> preached in the Abbey, &amp; afterwards came to supper.  Reggie &amp; Gilbert were here.</p>

<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> returned from Scotland on Friday, the 30<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> September.</p>
