         <p>The day began with a deluge of rain.  With brief intervals the rain continued all day, &amp; was even violent about 6 p.m.  
<persName xml:id="2315" display="no">Miss Maxwell</persName> carried us off to the parish church (quoad sacra).  The minister (
<persName xml:id="2318" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Andrews</persName>) has a kindly &amp; intelligent face, and a strong Scottish accent.  His prayers were trying, as 'extempore' prayers generally are to Liturgy&#8211;bred Anglicans.  The sermon from the text, "He came into His own &amp; His own received Him not", was apparently read, &amp; seemed to me ill suited to the congregation, but not in itself unworthy.  There was a mixed choir of young men &amp; women, which sang with much vigour to the accompaniment of a raucous harmonium.  The church itself was a very cheap, poor, barn&#8211;like structure, and the seats horribly uncomfortable.</p>
         <p>Miss Maxwell tells me that magpies are very numerous here.  No less than 50 were killed in a single year.  They make havock among the small birds.</p>
         <p>I finished reading an excellent story by 
<persName xml:id="2384">Whyte Melville</persName>, <ref xml:id="405">'The Gladiators'</ref>.  Also I wrote to
