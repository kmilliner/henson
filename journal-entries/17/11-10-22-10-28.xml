         <p>It rained all night, &amp; was still raining heavily when I went to Church for the early service.  Only 11 communicants.</p>
         <p>A hurricane came on suddenly about 10.30 a.m.: &amp; had the effect of stopping the rain while inducting annoyances of its own.  The congregation in S. Martin's was large but far less than might have been expected if the weather had been favourable.  <hi rend="bold underline">I preached to the 
<orgName xml:id="194">Navy League</orgName> from Amos ix.7, 8</hi><hi rend="bold">.  </hi>Outside the Church two ancient mariners &#8211; Admirals 
<persName xml:id="2556">Freemantle</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2557">Blomfield</persName>&#8211; thanked me warmly for the sermon.</p>
         <p>At Eventide the rain fell again with alarming vehemence.  However there was a considerable congregation in the Abbey, when I preached on 'Patriotism'.  The sermon had been carefully prepared, but it fell flat: &amp; disappointed me in all respects.</p>
         <p>The M.S. of the morning's discourse was sent (at the Editor's request) to the <ref xml:id="326">"Church Family Newspaper"</ref>. The M.S. of the evening's oration went to the <ref xml:id="325">'Christian World Pulpit'</ref>.</p>

         <p>On Saturday Oct. 28<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1911.], I attended the Conference of clergy &amp; doctors.  
<persName xml:id="148">Sinclair</persName> never turned up, so I took the chair.  We amended the 
<orgName xml:id="13" display="no">Committee's</orgName> Report, and adopted the Resolutions re&#8211;appointing it on a permanent basis with the Dean as Chairman.</p>
