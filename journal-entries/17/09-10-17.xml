         <p>A warm, wet, woeful morning.  I celebrated at 8 a.m. in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's</orgName>.  There were 17 cts., only 4 men.  Then I tried to furbish up an old sermon.  The difficulty is to think one's self back into the mood &amp; situation in which the sermon was originally composed.  There was a larger congregation than the weather seemed to promise, but much smaller than a fine day would have witnessed.  I preached on S. Paul's admonition to the Romans, "Take thought for things honourable in the sight of all men."  
<persName xml:id="2032"><hi rend="italic underline">D</hi><hi rend="i sup u">r</hi><hi rend="italic underline"> Newman Smyth</hi></persName><hi rend="italic">, with his

He has considerable natural qualifications for the social r&#x00F4;le of a bore, but is evidently a good man, obsessed with the notion that re&#8211;union is possible on the basis of a moderate episcopacy.  'I hae my doots', but the ambition is not unworthy.</hi>
