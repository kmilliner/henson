         <p>I celebrated in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>.  There were 24 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.  At Mattins, I attended service in the Abbey: where an effective appeal for the "Missions to Seamen" was made by the superintendent, 
<persName xml:id="2054" display="no">Wilson</persName>.</p>
         <p><hi rend="italic">There was a large congregation in the Abbey at 3.p.m.  I <ref xml:id="446">preached</ref> from Hebrews XIII.8.  "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, yea &amp; forever".  </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">The sermon was a hostile criticism of the "New Theology", and particularly of 
<persName xml:id="392">Campbell's</persName> <ref xml:id="320">article in the Hibbert Journal Supplement</ref></hi><hi rend="italic">.  I sent the <ref xml:id="321">MS. to the "Christian World Pulpit"</ref>, with a note to the 
<persName xml:id="2055" display="no">Editor</persName> asking him to insert it if possible in the next issue of his paper.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I went to S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's at 7 p.m.  There was but a moderate congregation, <hi rend="bold underline">for the 
<persName xml:id="276">Bishop of Durham</persName> was preaching in the Abbey, &amp; drew away some of the people</hi>. 
<persName xml:id="122">Hine&#8211;Haycock</persName> preached excellently.  It was his last sermon as one of my staff.</p>
         <p>At supper were

         <p>On Monday, November 22<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> 1909, I went across to the House of Lords, and observed from the Strangers' Gallery the opening of the debate on the Budget.  It was a fine spectacle.  
<persName xml:id="1591">Lord Lansdowne</persName> was evidently distressed by a bad cold, and possibly weighted by a bad (political) conscience, <hi rend="bold underline">for he is certainly carrying the country into a constitutional conflict of which no man can foresee the end</hi>.  <note xml:id="106" n="1"></note> 
<persName xml:id="1364">The Lord Chancellor</persName> spoke well &amp; impressively:  
<persName xml:id="703">Lord Halsbury</persName> played the buffoon with amazing esprit &amp; vigour, considering that he verges towards 90.  He was followed by the 
<persName xml:id="172">Bishop of Bristol</persName>, <hi rend="bold underline">who made one blush for one's cloth</hi>.</p>
         <p>On Tuesday, Nov: 23<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi> 1909, Hine&#8211;Haycock was installed as Precentor at Mattins.</p>
         <p>On Wednesday, Nov: 24<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1909, the 
<orgName xml:id="124">Church Missionary Society</orgName> came to S. Margaret's for Holy Communion at 10 a.m.  There were, however, but 87 communicants, &amp; &#x00A3;5 in the Offertory, which was given to the Society.</p>
         <p>On Thursday, Nov. 25<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>, I went to Plumstead, and addressed a large assembly in the Wesleyan Mission Hall, in connection with the 4<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> anniversary of their Mission.</p>
