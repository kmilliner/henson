         <p>~~"The Word of God to the faithful is an Armoury, out of which they may furnish themselves with all kind of munition; a Magazine, out of which they may be furnished with all manner of needful provision: whereas on the contrary, he which lives without making this his rule; he who sets not the Dial or Clock of his life by this Sun: he who directeth not his course in walking by this North Pole, or lode&#8211;star, but by the wavering, uncertain &amp; moveable stars of custom, example, reason, or good intentions sails without a compass, &amp; may look every minute to be swallowed up in the Ocean of sin &amp; judgement."~~</p>

         <p>I went across to S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's to receive the 
<persName xml:id="166">Bishop of London</persName>, who celebrated the Holy Communion for the Diocesan Conference, which I did not attend:</p>
         <p><hi rend="bold underline">An "urgent" letter from 
<persName xml:id="293">Edwin</persName> implored me to telegraph him &#x00A3;3 to pay the fine which the Germans had imposed on him for smuggling at Hamburg.  I did this forthwith, though whether wisely or no, I know not</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi>

         <p>Then I called on Hodder &amp; Stoughton, and saw 
<persName xml:id="2265">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Stoughton</persName> about the little volume. He acceded to my proposals.</p>
         <p>The service in connection with 
<persName xml:id="2266">Sir Edward Bradford's</persName> Funeral was numerously attended; a large number of police inspectors came.  The 
<persName xml:id="296">Sub&#8211;dean</persName> read the Lesson; I read the prayers; and the 
<persName xml:id="325">Dean</persName> gave the Benediction.  
<persName xml:id="2197">Pleasance</persName> sang the Anthem, "I know that my Redeemer liveth", very beautifully.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="122">Hine Haycock</persName> &amp; I went across the Parks with Logic.  The Queen's Statue is very imposing.<note xml:id="129" n="1"></note></p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I went to the annual Meeting of the Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church of England. The Hall was practically full. I was very well received, &amp;, though I spoke last after a long meeting, the audience stayed to the end of my speech.</p>
