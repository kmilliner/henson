         <p>I attended the Chapter Meeting.  The Sub&#8211;dean's stables were assigned to me.  
<persName xml:id="636">Pearce</persName>, though still but canon&#8211;designate, was suffered to be present.  He lunched with me afterwards.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I attended a meeting of the 
<orgName xml:id="195">London Congregational Board</orgName>, &amp; addressed the members on '<hi rend="underline">Welsh disendowment &amp; Christian Fraternity</hi>'.  There were about 100 congregational Ministers present.  My paper was listened to with the closest attention.  
<persName xml:id="2596" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Morgan Gibbon</persName>, a very fierce looking fanatick, made a violent speech, but he seemed to me not to make as much impression as he intended &amp; expected.  
<persName xml:id="2597">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Macfadyan</persName> was much more moderate.</p>
