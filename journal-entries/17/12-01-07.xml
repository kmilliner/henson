         <p>~~Though few men will confess their sins; yet many men's sins will confess their master.  To beget a precedent of vice is like the setting a man's own house on fire, it burns many of his neighbours, &amp; he shall answer for all the ruins. Alas!  while I live, I sin too much: let me not continue longer in wickedness than life.~~ </p>

<persName xml:id="1019">Addis</persName> preached an excellent sermon in the Abbey taking as his text the words of Isaiah 'To whom then will ye liken God?' &amp; the words of S. Paul, which &#8211; he said &#8211; answered the prophet's question., 'The Son of His Love, Who is the Image of the invisible God'. 
<persName xml:id="2258">Mosse</persName>, the Vicar of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Paul's, Covent Garden, preached in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's in the interest of the 
<orgName xml:id="23">S.P.G.</orgName> Missionary exhibition. Both these clergymen came to lunch afterwards.</p>
         <p>I <ref xml:id="614">preached</ref> in the Abbey at 3 p.m. on the Baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist. There was a fairly large congregation, &amp; they seemed still &amp; attentive; but my sermon was dull and circuitous, quite incapable of doing any good.  Yet I had bestowed much pains on it. My voice was not in good order, partly because I had celebrated at the 10 a.m. service, &amp; 'entertained' by conversation, the folks at lunch!</p>
         <p>I attended the evening service in the Abbey. 
<persName xml:id="216">Gow</persName> preached with much vigour. He gave an account of the pagan practices which survived in the Epiphany celebrations of Western Christendom, &amp; urged a resuscitation of the Festival as an annual exaltation of Purity.</p>
