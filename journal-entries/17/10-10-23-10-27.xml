         <p>A lovely morning.  I celebrated the Holy Communion at 8. a.m.  There were 29 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.  After service I exchanged greetings with the constables, and congratulated them on the conclusion of the Crippen case.  The wretched man was duly convicted and sentenced yesterday.<note xml:id="152" n="1"></note></p>
         <p>At Mattins there was a large congregation.  Among the Banns of Marriage were read out those of 
<persName xml:id="324">Amery</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2260">Miss Greenwood</persName>, and also those of 
<persName xml:id="521" display="no">Miss Oxford</persName>.  I preached an old sermon on the episode of Martha &amp; Mary: "The one thing needful".  After service the 'Dead March' was played in honour of Prince Francis of Teck, who died yesterday.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I walked in the Park with 
<persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName>, Gilbert, &amp; Reggie.</p>
         <p>At Evensong the Church was again very full.  Among the congregation was 
<persName xml:id="2508">F. E. Smith</persName>.  I preached from Psalm 112.7.  "He will not be afraid of any evil tidings: for his heart standeth fast, &amp; believeth in the Lord."</p>
