         <p>A tempestuous and chilly day.  The East Wind roaring round and through one made all things miserable.  There was a fair but nowise a crowded congregation when the 
<persName xml:id="532">Bishop of Ely</persName> preached a special sermon in connexion with the Tercentenary of the Authorized Version.  It was an excellent discourse both in substance and form.  I celebrated afterwards when there were but 27 com<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>There was a Church Parade of my 
<orgName xml:id="92">Territorials</orgName> in the afternoon.  
<persName xml:id="2236">Col: Willoughby</persName> read the lesson: I preached from I. Sam: xxi. 9. "There is none like that; give it me".  The singing was hearty: &amp; the men in their grey uniforms made a brave show.</p>
         <p>At Evensong there was a large congregation in spite of the hurricane.  I <ref xml:id="635">preached</ref> a careful sermon on the place of the Bible in the Christian life: and afterwards we sang a 'Te Deum' as a special act of Thanksgiving.</p>

From thence I wrote a longish letter to the "Spectator" headed <ref xml:id="373">"The excluding Rubric"</ref>, which duly appeared in the issue of that journal on the following Saturday.  I also wrote an <ref xml:id="374">Introduction</ref> to a small volume in which my <ref xml:id="375" display="no">Portsmouth Address</ref> to the
