         <p>~~'The crab has evidently been left behind and has adapted itself, not only to fresh&#8211;water life, but to conditions wh. would, at first sight, appear to be almost fatal to crab life.  It makes a burrow in the bank of a creek in which it can retain water sufficient to keep itself moist &amp; to tide over months of drought.'~~</p>
