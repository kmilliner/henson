<hi rend="bold">Passion Sunday, April 2</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">nd</hi><hi rend="bold">, 1911.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The deluge which began overnight still continued with no diminution of vigour when Sunday morning broke.  There were but 12 communicants at 8 a.m. when 
<persName xml:id="800">Westlake</persName> celebrated.</p>
         <p>Before Mattins I called on 
<persName xml:id="2526">Lady Dorington</persName> at 30 Queen Anne's Gate, to inquire after her husband 
<persName xml:id="696">Sir John</persName>, who, as I learned last night, was seriously ill.  The news was well&#8211;founded; &amp; we prayed for him in Church at the midday celebration.</p>
         <p>The rain spoiled the congregation at Mattins.  The nakedness of the land was covered by the presence of the 
<persName xml:id="784">Speaker</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="539">Alfred Lyttelton</persName>, 
<persName xml:id="679">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Ainsworth</persName>, &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2069">Sir John Barron</persName> in the parliamentary seats.  I preached &amp; celebrated.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="2255">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi></persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2256" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Marriott</persName> lunched here.  He is a relative of a well&#8211;known Tractarian.</p>
         <p>The Church was well&#8211;filled at Evensong.  
<persName xml:id="215"><hi rend="bold doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="bold superscript doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="bold doubleunderline"> Asquith</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> sate with the 
<persName xml:id="156">
<persName xml:id="2527" display="no">Churchwardens</persName></persName> during the service, but went out before the Sermon.</hi>  I preached a Passiontide Sermon on our Saviour's Lament over Jerusalem.</p>
         <p>Gilbert &amp; 
<persName xml:id="630">Bob</persName> were our only guests at supper.  I wrote to 
<persName xml:id="76">Mother</persName> in the course of the afternoon.</p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>On Monday April 3<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi>, the 
<orgName xml:id="66">Brotherhood</orgName> dined here.  There were but five of us.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="836" display="no">Buff</persName> arrived to stay here, &amp; be prepared for her Confirmation.</p>
         <p>On Wednesday, in bitter weather, I travelled to Bradford, &amp; addressed the Congregational Union of Yorkshire on the theme 'Denominationalism and Unity'.  The meeting was rather spoiled by the weather.</p>
         <p>On Thursday, the 6<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> April, I returned to Westminster.</p>
         <p>On Friday, the death of 
<persName xml:id="115">T. R. Buchanan</persName> was announced, earlier in the week the deaths of 
<persName xml:id="2529">Moberly Bell</persName>, Sir John Dorington and 
<persName xml:id="2530">E.H. Pember</persName> were reported.</p>
         <p>On Saturday I attended 
<orgName xml:id="13" display="no">Psycho&#8211;therapy</orgName> again.</p>
