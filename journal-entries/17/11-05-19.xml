         <p>~~Wit &amp; learning well used are like the golden earrings, &amp; bracelets of the Israelites; abused, like the same gold cast into a molten idol, than which nothing more abominable.  No such prey for the Devil, as a good wit unsanctified: great wits oft times mislead not only the owners, but many followers besides: as how many shall once wish they had been born dullards, when they shall find their wit &amp; learning to have barred them out of heaven.~~ </p>

<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> was taken to the play by her aunt; &amp; thus I had the evening to myself.</p>
