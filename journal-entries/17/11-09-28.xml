<persName xml:id="2553">Canon Douglas</persName> of New York called on me.  He sails for America next Sunday.  He has been collecting ideas for the constitution of the new Cathedral Chapter in New York.  He expatiated on the evils of the unmitigated democracy of his native land: &amp; expressed his desire to introduce an 'aristocratical' method by means of the Cathedral.  He disliked Episcopal nomination: and distrusted the laity.  The elements in the English system which attracted him most were Crown Appointment, Private patronage, &amp; the Freehold in the Benefice!  I had to remind him that the excellence of these arrangements had not secured general recognition among us, &amp; that in point of fact all three were vehemently attacked by our Church Reformers.  He did not succeed in making clear to me how the functions of the Canons of New York would differ from those of popular preachers. "Scholarship" is a vague term &amp; hardly suggests any definite work.  Yet he would make the connection between the Chapter &amp; the Life of the Church close &amp; intelligible.  The Canons receive about &#x00A3;650 annually; which is not magnificent.</p>
