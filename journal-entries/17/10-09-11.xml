<persName xml:id="2319" display="no">Mitchell</persName></hi> preached an excellent sermon on the prophet Jeremiah.  His style, perhaps, is too rhetorical, &amp; his delivery too declamatory.  The vergers say that he could not be heard in the transepts.  But this is a venial fault on the first trial of the building.  I celebrated in the Abbey at noon.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon there was again a very large congregation.  I preached on the Prayer of the Sons of Zebedee, making the text a basis for a discourse on Nepotism.</p>
         <p>After the service 
<persName xml:id="1266">Prof. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Moore</hi></persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2321" display="no">his daughter</persName> came to tea.  He was very interesting, giving us a vivacious account of 
<persName xml:id="2324">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Grenfell</hi></persName>, with whom he spent a holiday in Labrador, and whom he holds in the highest regard.</p>
         <p>At 7 p.m. the Abbey was crowded for the third time today.  
<persName xml:id="2325"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Baumgarten</hi></persName> preached an extempore sermon, which, however, could have been heard by but a small part of the congregation, as he never took the trouble of raising his voice above the conversational pitch.</p>
