         <p>Still feeling wretched with a bad cold.  I did not get up for the early service.  At Mattins the 
<persName xml:id="212">Dean of Canterbury</persName> preached an excellent sermon in the interest of the 
<orgName xml:id="186" display="no">Cathedral Restoration Fund</orgName>.  He came in to lunch, &amp; was very amiable.  
<persName xml:id="117"><hi rend="bold underline">Rashdall</hi></persName> preached in the Abbey, and also lunched here.</p>
         <p>I preached in the Abbey at 3 p.m. with difficulty.  There was a large congregation.</p>
         <p>At Evensong I preached in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> to a large congregation. My text was from Eph. v, "<hi rend="bold underline">Giving thanks always for all things</hi>", &amp; my sermon was designed with special reference to the <hi rend="bold underline">National Thanksgiving for the Return of their Majesties from India</hi>.  The collection was for the Canterbury Cathedral Restoration Fund, &amp; amounted to over &#x00A3;13.  This brings the total for the day to nearly &#x00A3;48.</p>

         <p>On Wednesday, the 14<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Feb. 1912, the King opened a new Session of Parliament.  His speech announces three revolutionary measures &#8211; <hi rend="bold underline">Welsh Disestablishment</hi>, <hi rend="bold underline">Irish Home Rule</hi>, and a <hi rend="bold underline">Suffrage Bill</hi>.</p>
         <p>Later in the day I travelled to Faversham, and addressed a meeting gathered by the local 
<orgName xml:id="96">Church Defence Committee</orgName> to oppose the Welsh Bill.  
<persName xml:id="1347"><hi rend="bold underline">Lord Harris</hi></persName> presided.  
<persName xml:id="205"><hi rend="bold underline">Foster Cunliffe</hi></persName> was the 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> speaker, &amp; I followed.  We each spoke for nearly an hour<hi rend="bold underline">!</hi>
         </p>
         <p>On Thursday, the 15<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Feb: 
<orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName> met, &amp; sat on until Saturday.  I did not attend, being compelled to get on to my Lenten work: but we entertained large parties of members at lunch: &amp; put up for the meetings &#8211; 
<persName xml:id="1219"><hi rend="bold underline">Stocks</hi></persName>, 
<persName xml:id="2613"><hi rend="bold underline">Kirkpatrick</hi></persName>, 
<persName xml:id="1123"><hi rend="bold underline">McArthur</hi></persName>, &amp; 
<persName xml:id="208"><hi rend="bold underline">Beeching</hi></persName>.</p>
         <p>On Saturday 
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I dined at the Deanery.  
<persName xml:id="114">Welldon</persName> was there, as boisterous as ever.</p>
         <p>On Friday, the 16<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Feb. 
<persName xml:id="1342"><hi rend="bold underline">Lord Lister's</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> Funeral</hi> was conducted with decent pomp in the Abbey Church.  </p>
