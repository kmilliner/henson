<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I attended the Moderator's Breakfast in the North British Hotel.  Then we bought the Scotsman &amp; the Glasgow Herald, &amp; read them in the Gardens: there is rather a mischievous leader in the <ref xml:id="381" display="no">Scotsman</ref> in which my name comes pretty often.</p>
         <p>Then I called on Blackwood &amp; Sons, 45 George Street.  The old 
<persName xml:id="2393">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Blackwood</persName> has a very distinguished appearance &amp; was most polite.  They are to publish my <ref xml:id="376">"Robert Lee"</ref> Lecture.</p>
         <p>I looked in on the Assembly: &amp; then went off to lunch with 
<persName xml:id="1139">Wallace Williamson</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="1759">Kay</persName> &#8211; both excellent men: after this I bought the "Times" which has a whole <ref xml:id="382">column</ref> of my lecture.</p>
         <p>Then Ella rejoined me, &amp; we spent an hour in seeing the Advocates' Library under the guidance of 
<persName xml:id="2392" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Dickson</persName>, the Librarian.  He has just discovered in the Library a fine Hebrew Bible, said to be of the XIII<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century.</p>
         <p>Mine host &amp; I attended the dinner of the 
<orgName xml:id="192">Elders Association</orgName>.  In the absence of 
<persName xml:id="1183">Lord Balfour of Burleigh</persName>, thro' illness, the 
<persName xml:id="2391">Master of Polwarth</persName> presided.  I proposed the toast of the Church of Scotland, which was responded to by 
<persName xml:id="1135">Mitford Mitchell</persName>.  As I walked home I admired the mild beauty of the new moon in a cloudless sky.</p>
