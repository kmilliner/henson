         <p>~~'While were talking of the ill state the church was in, I was struck to hear a prince of his course of life so much disgusted at the ambition, covetousness, &amp; the scandals of the clergy.  He said, if the clergy had done their part, it had been an easy thing to run down the nonconformists: but, he added, they will do nothing, &amp; will have me do everything: &amp; most of them do worse than if they did nothing.'~~</p>
