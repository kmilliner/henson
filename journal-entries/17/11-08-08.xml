         </p>
         <p>I read aloud at breakfast the speeches of 
<persName xml:id="508">Balfour</persName> and 
<persName xml:id="215">Asquith</persName> on the Vote of Censure debate.  Both were admirable efforts; but the 
<persName xml:id="215">Prime Minister's</persName> defence was really triumphant.</p>
         <p>Then 
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I went to the Kodak shop to buy films; &amp; to Mess<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Tho<hi rend="superscript underline">s</hi> Cook &amp; Son's Office to order tickets.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="1204">Mary Scott</persName> lunched with us, &amp; then went off to the station with Ella, who journeyed to Devonshire to make stay with 
<persName xml:id="290">Charles</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="950">Dorothy</persName>.  I went to camp, arriving about 7.30 p.m.  The Quartermaster met me, &amp; drove me in a very rickety little cart to the camp, where I joined the officers at Dinner.</p>
         <p>There are between 4000 &amp; 5000 men here on the healthiest site in the world.  We (the 
<orgName xml:id="200">Civil Service Rifles</orgName>) are in the centre, about 680 strong: on our left are the London Scottish (800 strong): &amp; the Kensington Rifles: on our right, the Queen's Westminsters, &amp; the Artists.  There are some Artillerymen besides.</p>
