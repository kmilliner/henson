         <p>A gusty, clouded yet close &amp; wearying day, with much promise of rain &amp; no fulfilment.  We loafed about all the morning: and in the afternoon visited the Flower Show in the village.  
<persName xml:id="2564">Miles</persName> gained the 1<hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi> prize for Table decoration: &amp; 
<persName xml:id="642">his father</persName> gained several prizes for vegetables.  
<persName xml:id="2276">Richard Probie</persName>, the Conservative candidate for this division of Essex, came to the Show, there to win hearts as the first step to winning votes.  He is a good&#8211;looking young man of 24.</p>
         <p>The post brought me a letter from the 
<persName xml:id="532">Bishop of Ely</persName> acknowledging receipt of a copy of <ref xml:id="383">"The Road to Unity"</ref>, and taking occasion to express his discomfort with the same.  His Lordship's <ref xml:id="529">recently published views on 'Confirmation'</ref> are so contrary to a principal thesis of mine that his approval could scarcely be reckoned on.</p>
