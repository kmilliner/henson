         <p>Yesterday the newspapers reported 22Â° of frost, &amp; today the cold seems even more intense.  The effect on the congregations was what might have been expected.  Yet there were more in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 11 a.m. than I expected.  I preached from the lessons for the day, &amp; <hi rend="bold underline">introduced into my sermon an allusion to the death of the Duke of Fife</hi>.  Also I celebrated Holy Communion.  There were 62 communicants.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I preached in the Abbey to a small &amp; very noisy congregation.  At the 
<persName xml:id="325">Dean's</persName> request I spoke about <hi rend="bold underline">Dickens</hi>, whose centenary is being kept. My text was Romans xii.16, <hi rend="bold">"</hi><hi rend="bold underline">Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly</hi><hi rend="bold">".  </hi>
<persName xml:id="215"><hi rend="bold underline">Asquith</hi></persName><hi rend="bold underline"> occupied the stall next the Dean</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The 
<persName xml:id="1123">Bishop of Southampton</persName> came to tea after service.  The morning preacher in the Abbey was the 
<persName xml:id="2179"><hi rend="bold underline">Rev Cyril Emmet</hi></persName> who has been taking up the cudgels for 
<persName xml:id="2237" display="no"><hi rend="bold underline">Thompson</hi></persName> in the "XIX<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Century".</p>

         <p>On Monday, the 5<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Feb., we had a special service of Thanksgiving for the King's Return.</p>
         <p>On Tuesday, the 6<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Feb. the King &amp; Queen drove to S. Paul's &amp; attended a Thanksgiving Service <hi rend="b strikethrough underline">in the Abbey</hi>.  </p>
         <p><hi rend="italic bold underline">The Committee of the 
<orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName> elected me under Rule 2, as 'a person of distinguished eminence in science, literature, or the arts, or for public services'.  
<persName xml:id="344">Sir Henry Craik</persName> ran round to tell me. It was kind of him, &amp; I am pleased with the compliment but I feel more imposturous than ever</hi><hi rend="i bold">!</hi>
         </p>
         <p>On Wednesday, the 7<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Feb, I dined with the 
<orgName xml:id="181">Leathersellers' Company</orgName>, and sate next 
<persName xml:id="2180"><hi rend="bold underline">Sir Robert Morant</hi></persName>, who proposed the health of the City Corporation &amp;c in a very windy &amp; wandering speech.</p>
         <p>On Thursday, the 8<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> Feb, we went with the 
<persName xml:id="648"><hi rend="bold underline">Car&#x00F6;es</hi></persName>
<persName xml:id="2127"></persName> to the 'Miracle'.  It is a fine spectacle but not otherwise impressive.</p>
