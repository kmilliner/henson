         <p>I went to the 
<orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName>, &amp; there wrote letters to 
<persName xml:id="830">Lord Cheylesmore</persName>, to 
<persName xml:id="1204">Mary</persName>, to 
<persName xml:id="2933" display="no">Percy Dearmer</persName>, &amp; another.</p>
         <p>After attending service in the Abbey as it was the Feast of our patron, S. Peter, and listening to a very short sermon from the 
<persName xml:id="325">Dean</persName> mainly filled with the Petrine legends which he had diligently vamped up from 
<persName xml:id="505">Stanley's</persName> <ref xml:id="536" display="no">book</ref>, we 'took up our carriages', &amp; travelled from Charing Cross by the slowest of trains to Strood, where we were met, &amp; carried to the Deanery of Rochester.  The Deanery is a fine house of the 17<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> century (mainly) with later enlargements, &amp; attached to it there is a garden of no less than 3 Â½ acres surrounded by an ancient wall, &amp; containing some remains of Roman work.  At the Deanery were staying the 
<persName xml:id="379">Dean's</persName> brother, 
<persName xml:id="2635">Sir Ronald Lane</persName>, a fine&#8211;looking and amiable old soldier: &amp; two young ladies, respectively the 
<persName xml:id="2636">daughter</persName> &amp; the niece (
<persName xml:id="2637" display="no">Rosamond Philips</persName>) of our hosts.  A Flag&#8211;lieutenant stationed at Chatham made up our dinner party.</p>
