         <p>The temperature had risen in the course of the night, and when morning came there came also a fine soaking of rain.</p>
         <p>At Mattins the congregation was disappointingly small, especially in the article of Members of Parl<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi>, which was the more regrettable as I had prepared a 'political' sermon with a view to the General Election, which is announced before Christmas.  I preached on a threefold text &#8211; Eccles: xi. 1,2: S. Lk: xvi. 9: Gal: vi. 7.  
<persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName> &amp; his brother&#8211;in&#8211;law 
<persName xml:id="2523">Simpson</persName> were in church: also 
<persName xml:id="66">Pember</persName> &amp; 
<persName xml:id="937">his wife</persName>.</p>
         <p>At Evensong the Church was well filled.  I preached a much&#8211;revised old sermon.</p>
         <p>On Tuesday, the 22<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> Nov. I shewed Fleming's party over the Abbey, &amp; afterwards lunched at the 
<orgName xml:id="174">Caledonian Club</orgName>.  
<persName xml:id="1182" display="no">Miss Lister</persName> 'took' 
<persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; me to the 'Comedy' Theatre to see 'Vice Vers&#x00E2;' &#8211; a very ludicrous play.<note xml:id="125" n="1"></note>  The fog was so dense that our cab refused to proceed, &amp; we were guided home by a passing man.</p>
         <p>On Wednesday I went to Sheffield to fulfil my promise to the Weslyans. I stayed with 
<persName xml:id="2136">Mitchell</persName>, the vicar of S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Augustine's.  On Thursday I preached at noon; &amp; addressed a great meeting at 7.30 p.m. in the Victoria Hall.  On Friday morning I returned to Westminster.</p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>On Friday (Nov: 25<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1910) I dined with the 
<orgName xml:id="164" display="no">Glasgow University Club</orgName> as the guest of 
<persName xml:id="344">Sir Henry Craik</persName>.  
<persName xml:id="1018">Curzon</persName>, the Lord Rector, was in the Chair.  I sat next him, &amp; had much interesting conversation.  He told me that the reforming programme which has been voted on in the Lords was hatched in his house on the Sunday preceding the debate.  The Conservative leaders met there, &amp; spent five or six hours of the Lord's Day in discussing the situation, &amp; determining their policy.  Curzon's speech was very brilliant &amp; humourous.</p>
         <p>On Saturday afternoon (Nov: 26<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi> 1910) I attended the 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> meeting of the "
<orgName xml:id="13" display="no"><hi rend="underline">Psycho&#8211;Therapic</hi>"</orgName> Committee.  There were 4 doctors, 4 clergymen, &amp; 
<persName xml:id="2178">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Rhoades</persName>, the Secretary.  We made some progress, mainly on my <hi rend="underline">rationalistic</hi> lines: but 
<persName xml:id="2288">Robinson</persName> was not present: had he been so, we sh<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> certainly have been less harmonious.</p>
         <p>In the evening we dined with the 
<persName xml:id="566">
<persName xml:id="2246" display="no">Flemings</persName></persName>.  There was present 
<persName xml:id="2015">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Carnegie Simpson</persName>, the editor of 
<persName xml:id="268">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Rainy's</persName> Life.  He is not an attractive person to look at, but improves on acquaintance.</p>
