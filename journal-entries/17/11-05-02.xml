<orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName> met in the 
<placeName xml:id="13">Church House</placeName>.  Our new 
<persName xml:id="325">Dean</persName> was presented by 
<persName xml:id="691">Archdeacon Fearon</persName>.  He sate at the table, but took no part in the discussions.  We were engaged all day on Prayer book Revision.  I spoke twice, &amp; succeeded in expressing my contempt for the 
<orgName xml:id="171" display="no">House of Laymen</orgName>, whose recent vote in opposition to Revision was often referred to.  We had a numerous party to lunch.</p>
