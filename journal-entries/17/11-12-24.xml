         </p>
         <p>A warm, wet morning &amp; very dark.  I celebrated at 8 a.m. in 
<orgName xml:id="16">S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Margaret's</persName>.  There were 13 communicants including myself &#8211; 5 males &amp; 8 females.</p>
         <p>Rain fell heavily before &amp; during morning service.  The congregation reflected the fact; yet there were more present than I expected.  My sermon was based on the Epistle for the Day.  I gave it a direction adapted to the Holy Communion tomorrow.</p>
         <p>After lunch the 
<persName xml:id="325">Dean</persName> called to say that the 
<persName xml:id="128">Abp.</persName> wanted a consecration in the Abbey on Jan<hi rend="superscript underline">y</hi> 25<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>.  I saw no objection.</p>
         <p>There was no sermon at Evensong.  Carols were sung &amp; a '<hi rend="underline">Te Deum</hi>' at the close of the service.  The congregation was very large.  
<persName xml:id="2605" display="no">Ferguson</persName>, the Organist of Lancing, was at the organ.  He played much too loudly.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="344">Sir Henry Craik</persName> was in dudgeon at the musick: &amp; <hi rend="italic">expressed himself very testily in the vestry. Apparently he did so to 
<persName xml:id="800">Westlake</persName> with such effect that the latter promptly wrote to resign!!</hi>  This is a pleasant episode in the Christmas festivities.</p>
