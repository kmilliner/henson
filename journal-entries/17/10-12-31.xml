<persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName> arrived in the course of the afternoon in order to stay with us for a few days. He is fitly under my roof at the close of a year full of strain &amp; disappointment. Certainly <hi rend="bold underline">this year has no title to grateful recollection</hi>. It has been publicly disastrous, &amp; privately tiresome &amp; wearying. Nothing has been effectively done: little has been even attempted. Yet it has been a laborious time: &amp; my holiday seemed as unrefreshing as it was monotonous. After ten years here, I feel bruised &amp; baffled.  My melancholy infects my work.</p>
