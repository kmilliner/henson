         <p>We travelled very comfortably from Stockholm to L&#x00FC;beck, leaving at 8.30 p.m. on Monday, and arriving at 7.45 p.m. on Tuesday.  The weather was perfect.  Our two sea&#8211;passages &#8211; from Malm&#x00F6; to Copenhagen, &amp; from Gjedser to Wannem&#x00FC;nde &#8211; were transacted without the slightest discomfort.  On our arrival at the hotel Stadt Hamburg we were surprised to find 
<persName xml:id="2272" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Owen</persName> &amp; his friend.  We dined and went to bed.</p>
         <p>The steam&#8211;ferry from Gjedser to Wannerm&#x00FC;nde is remarkable.  Four (or five) railway carriages are run onto the ferry&#8211;boat which transfers them again to the railway lines on the other side.  There is a well&#8211;organised dining saloon on board, &amp; all the plant of a holiday steamer.</p>
         <p>Our luggage was inspected for the German customs on the steamer.  The performance was easily arranged by the guard.</p>
