         <p>The weather was dull &amp; dropping all the morning, and surprisingly fine in the afternoon.  I wrote some letters including one to 
<persName xml:id="1186">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Tait</persName>.  The 'Scotsman' announces the death of the 
<persName xml:id="387">Dean of Lincoln</persName>.  After finishing my letters I talked on religious questions for an hour with the young man, 
<persName xml:id="2479" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">c</hi>Queeny</persName>, who is staying here.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon 
<persName xml:id="1077">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Glassford Bell</persName> drove us to Pitlochry, where she wished to attend a Flower show &amp; Sale of Work.  The last I declined, &amp; walked with 
<persName xml:id="2481" display="no">Lady Bowden Smith</persName> to her house, where we all afterwards had tea.  Then 
<persName xml:id="2480" display="no">Miss Graeme</persName>, the youth, and I walked back over the hill, putting up a red deer by the way, and getting the most glorious views.  On the road I succeeded in losing my umbrella, probably while I was attempting to take a photograph.</p>
         <p>
<persName xml:id="1930" display="no">Walter Smith</persName> arriver at dinner time.</p>
         <p>I read through a grotesque book <ref xml:id="404">'A lost cause'</ref> by 
<persName xml:id="404">Guy Thorne</persName>.  There is a certain interest in it as showing the views held &amp; expressed among the Ritualists.</p>
