<hi>I breakfasted at the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName>, &amp; afterwards wrote a letter to the "Times". In the announcement of deaths, there appeared the name of that quaint but kindly person, Sir <persName xml:id="642">Peile Thompson</persName>, with whom I was to have been staying had it not been for the meetings of the Church &amp; State Committee. I spent the morning at Westminster attending the said meeting, &amp; there </hi><hi rend="bold underline">was a sharp episode between the <persName xml:id="545">Dean of Lincoln</persName> &amp; myself</hi><hi>. I lunched with <persName xml:id="117">Rashdall</persName> at the Club, &amp; afterwards walked with him for an hour. Then I returned to the Club, &amp; wrote letters. The damp, dark, depressing weather disinclined me to make calls. I dined at the Club, &amp; afterwards wrote up my Diary. Thus passed a very dull &amp; useless day!</hi>
