<hi>I attended Matins in the Cathedral: &amp; spent the rest of the morning in interviews with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4345">Norcock</persName></hi><hi>, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3618">Lilley</persName></hi><hi>, &amp; the <persName xml:id="3741">Dean</persName>. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3619">Bannister</persName></hi><hi> came in after lunch &amp; talked for an hour. Then I went across to the Deanery for tea. I went to the Palace, &amp; looked at the Chapel, a very squalid affair indeed: and the cellar, not as magnificent as might have been expected, but, by comparison with chapel, generous. "</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop <persName xml:id="475">Percival</persName></hi><hi> was, I suppose, a strict abstainer", I observed. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">"No:" replied <persName xml:id="4471" display="no">Batemen</persName>, "he was very strong on temperance: but he drank wine himself. He tried giving it up, &amp; it didn't suit his health to do so"</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> <hi>This is a representative example. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop <persName xml:id="276">Moule</persName></hi><hi> is an insistent advocate of total abstinence, but he himself takes wine on occasion. A telegram from </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName></hi><hi> announced "something wrong with the car", &amp; she w</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> spend the night at Lichfield, &amp; arrive here tomorrow. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3571">George</persName></hi><hi> sent a telegram announcing his arrival in London. He will be disappointed to find the Deanery vacant. I wrote several letters, &amp; revised the proofs of my new volume of sermons. For some unimaginable reason the compositor has used the largest capitals for the Divine Name, wherever it appears, with the result that the pages have a crude &amp; restless appearance, very annoying to the eye of the reader. Yet to correct this will imply a large number of alterations, &amp; probably add considerably to the labour &amp; cost of production, a circumstance not lightly to be dismissed as things now stand with us. However, I did make the corrections, &amp; decided to let <persName xml:id="1330">Macmillan</persName> take his own course with respect to them.</hi>
