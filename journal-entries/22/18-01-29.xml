<hi>I put together 21 sermons preached, mostly in the Cathedral, during the last 2 years: and wrote to George <persName xml:id="1330">Macmillan</persName>, suggesting a "second series" of "War&#8211;Time Sermons"<ref xml:id="84"></ref>, as an indirect reply on my part to the agitation. Cecil <persName xml:id="4218">Ferens</persName> came to lunch, and then took me for a walk. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> had a numerous party of visitors at tea, among them were Colonel <persName xml:id="3512">Darwin</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3813">his wife</persName>. I presided at a lecture on "Mesopotamia" in the Town Hall by a certain Canon <persName xml:id="4350">Parfit</persName>. There was a large attendance. The lecture was far too long, &amp; the lecturer did not inspire me with much confidence.</hi>
