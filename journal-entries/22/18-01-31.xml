<hi>We left Durham by the early train, &amp; came to London easily enough, arriving about half an hour after time. The journey was relieved by the conversation of a chaplain, who told me that his name was Gibbons (?) [sic] a Fellow of Balliol. He had been living in the area about Peronne devastated by the Germans, and gave a horrible account of their barbarity. He is now apparently employed in addressing assemblies of artisans on the War. The Tyne&#8211;siders were, he found, responsive enough, but not the men on the Clyde, among whom are many Poles &amp; other foreigners.</hi>
