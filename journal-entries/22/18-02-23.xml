I put together a bundle of documents for my successor. It seems certain now that I shall have no opportunity of discussing business with him face to face. The old Bible from Barking, displaced when the R.V. was introduced, I sent across to the <persName xml:id="2785">Bishop of Jarrow</persName>, asking him to dispose of it to some poor parish in the Durham diocese. The "Ancient &amp; Modern" hymn&#8211;books which were in the Rectory Chapel in <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName> I sent across to <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName>, for use in the Cathedral. I took the inventory of my wine, &amp; found that there still lingered in the cellar about 300 bottles, mainly claret. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">We have distributed our surplus of tea to the vergers, almsmen, hospital, and neighbours</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> <hi>There remains the coal: which presumably my successor will purchase. <persName xml:id="3178">Hadow</persName> came to lunch.
