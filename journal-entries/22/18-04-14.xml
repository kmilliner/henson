<hi>The bitterly cold wind continues. In the teeth of it <persName xml:id="77">Marion</persName> and I went to the parish church at 8 a.m., and received the Holy Communion. After breakfast I read a curiously muddle&#8211;headed piece of work â€“ "</hi><hi rend="underline">Watchman, What of the Night? being some thoughts on the Position &amp; Ideals of the Church of England by R. H. <persName xml:id="4318">Malden</persName>, Principal of Leeds Clergy School</hi><hi>["]. I had promised Geo. <persName xml:id="1330">Macmillan</persName> to tell him what I thought of it. Then I attended Mattins in the Parish Church, &amp; heard a sermon from the <persName xml:id="4066">Rector</persName>. I was not unfavourably impressed for the service was reverent, &amp; the sermon coherent. In the Post Office was posted a telegram from Sir D. <persName xml:id="4097">Haig</persName> reporting desperate fighting which was mainly favourable to us.</hi>
