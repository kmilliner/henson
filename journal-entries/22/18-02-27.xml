<hi>In the course of the morning, I called at the Petrol Controller's Office in Berkeley Street, and had an interview with a dejected female, who caused me to fill up a form, &amp; promised me a monthly supply of 30 gallons. The office appeared to be "manned" by excited &amp; incompetent flappers, &amp; there was an impression of regnant chaos! I called at the Church Printing Company's office in Burleigh Street, &amp; ordered note paper properly stamped. The clerk would make no promise as to the date of delivery, nor give any security as to the quality of the paper!</hi>
