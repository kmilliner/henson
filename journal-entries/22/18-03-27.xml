<hi>The weather is much colder, &amp; the sky was over&#8211;cast. I began a sermon for use in the Cathedral on Easter Day. After lunch I motored to Whitbourne, and confirmed about 50 persons in the parish church. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went with me, and after service we had tea with the <persName xml:id="4256">parson's</persName> brother, Sir Richard <persName xml:id="4255">Harington</persName>, formerly a Judge in India, who has become the owner of the original Harington house (if I understood correctly what I was told) itself an ancient episcopal residence. He impressed me as an intelligent &amp; interesting man. </hi><hi rend="italic">When we returned home we found a telegram announcing the arrival of Harold. We were in some doubt as to the identity of the sender, whether it was <persName xml:id="1097">Harold Henson</persName> or <persName xml:id="113">Harold Knowling</persName>. It turned out to be the latter, very little altered in appearance by the labour &amp; illness of Salonika. He had much to say of the ill&#8211;conduct of the French, who appear to be represented in the Balkans by their worst troops.</hi>
