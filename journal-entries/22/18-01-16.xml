<hi>Breakfast was relieved by the talk of the Bp. of <persName xml:id="3920">Dover</persName>, but was quite a melancholy meal. After it was ended, I had a brief final talk with the <persName xml:id="128">Archbishop</persName>. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">He assured me that he realized that our conversation last night was private &amp; personal. I said that on no other assumption would I have spoken at all</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><hi> He dwelt on the trouble in which my consecration was immersing him. I could not help asking him whether his trouble would be any the less if I were to withdraw my acceptance of the bishoprick, abandon the efforts of my life, and retire from office in the Church of England. He admitted that it would not. He said prayers, and gave me his Blessing. I packed my bag, and went to Morley's Hotel, where I had reserved a room for the ensuing week. Then I went to the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName>, and wrote to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>.</hi>
         </p>

<hi>At 3.15 p.m. I went to the House of Lords, and saw the Vicar&#8211;General, Lord <persName xml:id="1736">Parmoor</persName>, in order to fix the date of the Confirmation. He offered me "congratulations" with every appearance of sincerity. I gather that nothing but an indication that the opponents are going to prosecute me for heresy will now "hold up" the consecration. The "Catholicks" are evidently holding counsel together. In the Athenaeum I observed Sir Walter <persName xml:id="1940">Phillimore</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="384">Prebendary Ingram</persName> as well as several whose faces sufficiently attested their character! <persName xml:id="1820">Charles</persName> and <persName xml:id="636">Pearce</persName> came in to the Club, and I had some speech with both.</hi>
