<hi rend="doubleunderline">Old Prebendary <persName xml:id="4349">Palmer</persName></hi><hi> came to see me with reference to S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Martin's Home for Penitents<orgName xml:id="304"></orgName>. The holy women in charge want to wear Vestments. I said that, as they were not parish clergy, &amp; their specific work was such that they had a fair claim to be granted indulgence, I should not think it necessary to interfere. I travelled to Craven Arms, &amp; was there met by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4265">Lord Powis's</persName></hi><hi> car, and driven to Clum, where </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> <persName xml:id="4314">Machem</persName></hi><hi> the Vicar, joined me, &amp; carried me to a cottage where I confirmed an old man of 80 in his bed. After tea at the Vicarage, I looked at the Parish Church of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> George, which is on a considerable scale, very massive &amp; gloomy. I motored to Lydbury North, &amp; there confirmed in his cottage another old man of 82. Then I went to Walcot, where I was hospitably entertained by </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">the Earl &amp; <persName xml:id="4271">Countess of Powis</persName></hi><hi>. This house was builded [sic] by the great </hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4168">Lord Clive</persName></hi><hi>, whose portrait adorns the drawing room. Many Indian objects are distributed over the rooms. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Powis</hi><hi> is rather a weak&#8211;looking man, amiable &amp; well&#8211;mannered, evidently proud of his family &amp; properties. His <persName xml:id="4270">heir</persName> was killed in France, &amp; the younger son, <persName xml:id="4267">Mervyn</persName>, a boy of 13, is preparing for <orgName xml:id="58" display="no">Eton</orgName>. A daughter in the "flapper" stage appeared, &amp; a heavy young man, Mervyn's tutor. Lady Powis said that she had been present in the <orgName xml:id="59" display="no">Chapel Royal</orgName> last Sunday, &amp; had approved my sermon! </hi><hi rend="italic">Lord Powis has extensive patronage in this part of my diocese, &amp; he relieves himself from trouble in making appointments by handing the task of finding suitable clergymen to his relative, </hi><persName xml:id="49"><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Bishop Gore</hi></persName><hi rend="italic">!</hi>
