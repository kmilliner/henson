<hi rend="italic">I received the Holy Communion in S. Gregory's Chapel<placeName xml:id="77"></placeName> at 8 a.m.: and attended Mattins. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">Then I answered a telegram from the editor of the Yorkshire Post<persName xml:id="1460"></persName> inquiring about reports as to the Hereford vacancy</hi><hi rend="italic">. "Have no information whatever on the subject". Later in the day I returned the same answer to the Editor of the "Hereford Times", who telegraphed a request that I would either "deny or confirm" the "strong rumours" in Hereford that I had "accepted Bishoprick of Hereford"!!! It is really getting beyond a joke. I spent the morning in tidying my room, and paying bills. <persName xml:id="4415">Sykes</persName> came to lunch, and afterwards we both attended a meeting of the "Church Defence &amp; Church Instruction" Committee<orgName xml:id="96"></orgName>. <persName xml:id="2817">Lady Londonderry</persName> was there, and had some gossip afterwards.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">After tea I read through the typed copy of so much of the <ref xml:id="996">"Life"</ref> as is now written. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">I was interrupted by the arrival of a reporter with fresh inquiries about Hereford, and he was not very easy to satisfy. Later came <persName xml:id="4382">Reeve</persName> with the same question, which had been asked on the telephone. It is an odious situation for, while I know nothing to authorize expectation, and cannot think it probable that any <persName xml:id="234">Prime Minister</persName> would make an appointment which w</hi><hi rend="i bold superscript underline">d</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline"> so certainly provoke the liveliest resentment in ecclesiastical circles, yet I have heard so much gossip on the matter, that I cannot put it easily aside, &amp;, of course, I know that if the offer were made, "Barkis is willin"</hi><hi rend="i bold">!!</hi>
