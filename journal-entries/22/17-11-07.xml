<hi>I have chosen the text of the sermon for next Sunday when the Mayor comes to the Cathedral to inaugurate his year of office. It is taken from the special Lesson:&#8211; "</hi><hi rend="underline">Who is my neighbour</hi><hi>?" I shall speak of the City as the sphere in which the neighbourly spirit should find its natural expression: in which there are many influences to develope neighbourliness: in which also the temptations as well as the opportunities of the neighbour's temper are present.</hi>

<hi>My Birthday begins to receive its recognition, mainly from my female friends. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4357">Elizabeth</persName></hi><hi> sent a skilfully fashioned string&#8211;box, manufactured by herself: </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName></hi><hi> sent a letter, &amp; some handkerchiefs: </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="1696">Olive</persName></hi><hi> wrote affectionately. I spent the morning, after attending Mattins, in reading </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4283">Howorth's</persName></hi><hi> "</hi><hi rend="underline">The Golden Days of the Early English Church</hi><hi>"<ref xml:id="962"></ref> in view of the </hi><hi rend="underline">Edinburgh Article</hi><hi>, for which that volume must serve as a text. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3444">Macartney</persName></hi><hi> came to lunch, as pleasant &amp; "feckless" as usual. He reports nothing worse from the Cathedral than the loss of slates &amp; the weathering of the stone. I walked through Houghall Wood. </hi><hi rend="italic">On the way I fell in with </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Captain <persName xml:id="2918">Apperley</persName></hi><hi rend="italic">, who suggested that Logic had met his fate in some rabbit hole, into which he had hurled himself in the ardour of the chase.
