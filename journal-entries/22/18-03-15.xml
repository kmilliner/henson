<hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><persName xml:id="4372"><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Purcell</hi></persName><hi>, the Rector of Morville, is an unmarried Irishman, strong to look at &amp; well&#8211;built, but with a weak heart, &amp; subject to attacks of neuritis. After breakfast he shewed me his church, which is interesting, a Norman nave &amp; tower. A font possibly pre&#8211;Conquest &amp; an archaic chest are noteworthy. I visited the parish school, &amp; talked to the children. Then I went to <placeName xml:id="87">Aldenham Park</placeName>, the seat of Lord </hi><persName xml:id="1125"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Acton</hi></persName><hi>, now let to M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="4120">Barber&#8211;Starkie</persName>, &amp; visited the fine library, now empty of books.<note xml:id="383" n="1"></note> I was told that the late </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Acton</hi><hi> left his affairs in great confusion, &amp; his estate heavily mortgaged. He would neither pay bills nor answer letters, with calamitous consequences to his <persName xml:id="4183">successor</persName>. </hi><hi rend="underline">Purcell</hi><hi> was eloquent on the ill&#8211;behaviour of </hi><persName xml:id="2021"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Father Frere</hi></persName><hi> &amp; another "Catholick" parson, who stayed in the parish, &amp; scandalized the villagers by not attending Divine service on Sunday. The inn in Morville is said to be comfortable. </hi><persName xml:id="3066"><hi rend="doubleunderline">"Father" Figgis</hi></persName><hi> has patronized it, a fact that may certify the victuals! M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> <hi>Barber&#8211;Starkie sent me in to Bridgenorth, by the motor. There </hi><persName xml:id="4167"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Clarke&#8211;Maxwell</hi></persName><hi> shewed me the town, which is extremely picturesque. The view over the Valley of the Severn from the Castle is superb. Charles I is said to have described it as the noblest in his dominions. </hi><persName xml:id="5"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Baxter's</hi></persName><hi> house, a humble but picturesque dwelling, is near S. Leonard's Church. The house where </hi><persName xml:id="4359"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Bishop Percy</hi></persName><hi> was born is now used as a soup&#8211;kitchen. I confirmed 125 persons, &amp; then returned to Hereford, where I arrived around 8.30 p.m. The journey from Droitwich to Hereford was relieved by the company &amp; conversation of </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Trevor Lloyd</hi><hi>, a 2</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi><hi> Lieutenant, who lives in these parts, &amp; was going home for a holiday.</hi>
