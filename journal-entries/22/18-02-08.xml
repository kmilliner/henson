<hi>I walked with the <persName xml:id="128">Archbishop</persName> to the <orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName>, and on the way </hi><hi rend="underline">I asked whether it was necessary to have private arms on ring and seal, and he said that it was not</hi><hi>. Convocation sate until lunchtime. The Bishop of <persName xml:id="3933">Peterborough</persName> made a much&#8211;complimented speech, (which he read) on the Church's attitude towards Labour questions. The debate was adjourned. I walked back to Lambeth, &amp; lunched with M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="404">Davidson</persName>. Then we took our leave of the Palace, and went to the Deanery of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Paul's. Here we parted, and I went to the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName>. I walked back to the Deanery along the Embankment as far as Chancery Lane with Sir Henry <persName xml:id="3946">Newbolt</persName>. He was curiously optimistic about the war; held that the threatened German offensive would not take place at all as the German Government could no longer depend on the troops: &amp; thought that <persName xml:id="4294">Jellicoe's</persName> speech about the submarines was really hopeful. I wish I could agree with all this. At the Deanery I found a note from the Secretary of the University Chest informing me that on receipt of fees amounting to &#x00A3;</hi><hi rend="underline">50.10.0</hi><hi> the diploma of the D.D. degree would be sent me. This is rather a formidable price to pay for an entirely insignificant compliment. I paid <persName xml:id="2995" display="no">Adeney's</persName> Bill for </hi><hi rend="underline">episcopalia</hi><hi> (&#x00A3;114.6.0). My available resources are quickly melting away before the heavier charges come in! And all this expenditure in order that I may be removed from a place where I am comparatively popular &amp; have little to do to another place where I shall be loathed &amp; overworked!</hi>
