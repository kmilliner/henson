<hi>I cleared up my papers, gave <persName xml:id="4345">Norcock</persName> some instruction about my books &amp; letters, &amp; went off to London. One of the choirboys,</hi> <persName xml:id="4474" display="no"><hi rend="underline">Norman West</hi></persName><hi>, came to see me. He said that the late <persName xml:id="475">bishop</persName> told the boys to see him when they left the school. On the platform the station&#8211;master introduced me to a Director who lives somewhere near Abbey Dore</hi><hi rend="italic">. I read through the Report of the Lambeth Ctee's Report in the train, &amp; I like it less than ever. As I was entering Morley's Hotel I fell in with <persName xml:id="3250">John Burns</persName> &amp; had some talk with him. He was very pessimistic about the war, and spoke of his own "noble reticence"! His conceit is so simple that it ceases to be offensive. I dined at the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName>, where I saw <persName xml:id="4213">Edgeworth</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1427">Baker&#8211;Wilbraham</persName>.</hi>
