<hi>There was a heavy snow fall during the night, and the frost was bitter. At first we meditated abandoning our purpose, but on telephoning to the station, and learning that the railway was open, we persevered, and travelled to town with no worse inconvenience than being a little late. We were warmly welcomed at the S. Paul's Deanery by <persName xml:id="427">Ralph</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1209">Kitty</persName> with their whole squad of children. Hardly had we settled down before an air&#8211;raid warning sent us all to the cellar. Here we continued most of 2 hours, and then returned to the upper regions. I was very tired, and went to bed about 10 p.m.</hi>
