<hi>I walked with the <persName xml:id="477">Bishop</persName> to the Cathedral for the Celebration at 8 a.m. The Lady Chapel looked very beautiful in the morning light. The Bishop was the Celebrant, &amp; took the North End. I noted that the acoustics of the building were excellent. Everybody went to church except me. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I went to my room, &amp; wrote a letter to the "Times" asking for some explanation of the summoning of the <orgName xml:id="57">Representative Church Council</orgName> to meet in November</hi><hi>, after the meeting in July had been cancelled in deference to the expressed wishes of 4/5</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">ths</hi><hi> of the members. The Committee of doctors came to lunch. The service at 3 p.m. was in S. Luke's Church, and was well&#8211;attended. I <ref xml:id="992">preached</ref> from the words, </hi><hi rend="underline">"He endured as seeing Him Who is invisible"</hi><hi>. The Offertory amounted to over &#x00A3;46, which was nearly twice the amount collected at last year's service. We had tea with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Hamilton</hi><hi>, &amp; then called on </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">D</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"> <persName xml:id="4235">Glyn</persName></hi><hi>, who occupies the house in which </hi><persName xml:id="879"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Gladstone</hi></persName><hi> was born. I accompanied the Bishop to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>, Prince's Road, where he preached for the <orgName xml:id="23">S.P.G.</orgName> The Vicar, </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4127">Bell Cox</persName></hi><hi>, was once regarded as an extreme "Ritualist", but is now far outpassed by the Romanizers. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4184">Darbyshire</persName></hi><hi>, the Vicar of S. Luke's, came to supper, with his sister. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lawrence <persName xml:id="3655">Holt</persName></hi><hi> also came. The Bishop had asked him at my request. He had been at this afternoon's service. The general opinion seems to be that the service was successful both in attendance and in itself.</hi>
