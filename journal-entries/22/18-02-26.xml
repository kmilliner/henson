<hi><persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went with me to the station. The station master said "Goodbye" with much feeling, &amp; the emotions of last night renewed themselves in my mind. I travelled in a crowded carriage, dense with tobacco&#8211;smoke, &amp; arrived at King's Cross 40 minutes after the time. Then I went to Morley's Hotel, &amp; deposited my bags. I called on <persName xml:id="2817">Lady Londonderry</persName> at 5 Carlton House Terrace, &amp; found her at home. She asked me to dine, which suited me admirably. So I walked to Westminster, &amp; called on <persName xml:id="2109" display="no">Miss Pearce</persName>: &amp; then returned to the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName> until 8.30 p.m. when I dined pleasantly with the Dowager &amp; <persName xml:id="4200">Miss Dillon</persName>. Lady L. confessed to a desire to become Mayor of Durham, &amp; extracted from me a promise to stay at Lumley when I go to receive the freedom in April. This is most kind, but I am not sure whether it is judicious to appear in Durham as an intimate of so Tory a Lady!!</hi>
