<hi rend="italic">O merciful God, have compassion on me, the worst and weakest of Thy servants, and forgive the sins &amp; blunders of another year. Thou knowest all my intentions, all my difficulties, all my failures. All things and my secret mind lie naked before Thee. Have mercy on me, O Lord, and cleanse me from my sin. Thy Will prevails in the affairs of men, and Thy Wisdom marks out the course of my life. Make known to me, I beseech Thee, the Purpose of Thy Providence, and give me grace to embrace it as mine own. Be with me in the new &amp; perilous road I must tread. "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Show Thou me the way that I should walk in for I lift up my heart unto Thee</hi><hi rend="italic">". Grant that my going to Hereford may help Thy people there, and set forward Thy kingdom. Give me wisdom, patience, &amp; courage. Cleanse my personal life, I entreat Thee, and give me a clearer vision of Thy Truth. "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">If Thy Presence go not with me, carry me not up hence</hi><hi rend="italic">". Turn the hearts of mine enemies, and bring their evil intentions to nought. Let Thy Peace rule in my mind in the midst of all the tumults &amp; confusions of this time. Open to me an entrance into the hearts of Thy People in Hereford, and enable me to serve them faithfully according to Thy Will. O loving Father, give me Thy Holy Spirit to consecrate me to this Work. "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Into Thy Hands I commend my spirit, for Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, Thou God of Truth</hi><hi rend="italic">". This my prayer I present in the Name of Jesus Christ, Thy Son our Lord.</hi>

<hi>My dear Bishop,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Thank you so much for your very kind letter, wh. was the more welcome to me for its candour. I certainly do not claim infallibility, &amp; it may well be the case that in the course of 30 years many things have been unwisely said. But the attitude which I have tried to take up &amp; maintain is, I am fully persuaded, both right in itself, &amp; indispensable in a Reformed Church. </hi><hi rend="underline">We</hi><hi> cannot take up the ostrich&#8211;like policy of the Vatican in front of the accumulating knowledge &amp; novel situations of our modern world. My personal opinions are far different indeed from many which yet I would not suffer to be roughly disallowed: and, indeed, I am most at home with men like yourself. Hoping, if God permit, for much co&#8211;operation in the future.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I am, my dear Bishop, </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Sincerely &amp; gratefully,</hi>
