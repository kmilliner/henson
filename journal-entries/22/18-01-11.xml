<hi>Miss <persName xml:id="3427">Lang</persName> went off to Scotland after breakfast. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went to Newcastle with <persName xml:id="3805">Fearne Booker</persName>: and I settled down to work at the commemoration sermon. The Church papers all print <persName xml:id="49">Gore's</persName> protest </hi><hi rend="underline">in extenso</hi><hi>, and add comments after their several kinds. The "Record" is clearly dominated by <persName xml:id="212">Wace</persName>, who has a letter in it, and announces another in the next issue. The "Guardian" is cautiously hostile. The "Church Times" assumes an almost triumphant air, and assumes that even the Dean of Durham must perceive that his case is hopeless, &amp; must retire from the conflict! </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I wrote to <persName xml:id="602">Burge</persName> and <persName xml:id="325">Ryle</persName>, asking them to act as the bishops required by the Rubrick to "present" me for consecration</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi><note xml:id="363" n="1"></note> <hi>Also I wrote to <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName> dissuading her from attendance at the Function in the Abbey on February 2</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi><hi>. My reasons are twofold. On the one hand, I fear the possibility of someone drawing attention to her German nationality, a fact on which a mountain of injurious innuendo would probably be built. On the other hand, I expect a scene in the Abbey, &amp; would face it more comfortably if the old &amp; dear lady were not present. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">The stream of congratulatory letters failed abruptly at the afternoon post</hi><hi>. This may be a mere accident, but I find it difficult not to connect it with the appearance of Gore's protest and Wace's letter. The sheeplike docility to their leaders which marks the Evangelicals makes it probable that they will all now take sides against me. Wace, <persName xml:id="586">Halifax</persName>, Gore &amp; <persName xml:id="4414">Darwell Stone</persName> are a formidable quartett [sic].</hi>
