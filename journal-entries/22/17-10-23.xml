<hi rend="bold underline"><ref xml:id="976">My letter</ref> appeared in the "Times</hi><hi>", &amp; may stir thoughts in the minds of the bishops assembled at Lambeth! I spent the morning in the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName> writing letters, &amp; reading. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">The <persName xml:id="242">Bishop of Manchester</persName> joined me at lunch. We discussed the situation in view of the meeting of the <orgName xml:id="57">R.C.C.</orgName> in November</hi><hi rend="italic">. He said that the opposition to him in his Diocesan Conference was practically confined to the <orgName xml:id="207">C.E.M.S.</orgName> "inspired from Bishopthorpe". We agreed that some protest should be attempted at the <orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName> against the meeting of the R.C.C.: &amp; that he should try to ascertain from the <persName xml:id="128">Abp.</persName> precisely whether, in the event of </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lord <persName xml:id="1736">Parmoor's</persName></hi><hi rend="italic"> motion being defeated, the discussion of the Church &amp; State Report w</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic"> proceed.

We talked together for an hour.</hi><hi> I returned to the Athenaeum, &amp; then went back to <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName>. I dined with the <persName xml:id="636">Pearces</persName>, with whom was staying the Bishop of <persName xml:id="2533">Bristol</persName>. We had a good deal of pleasant talk. The evening post brought me letters from </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4357">Elizabeth</persName></hi><hi>, and </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="2432">Colin Kennedy</persName></hi><hi>.

<hi>I called on </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Hugh <persName xml:id="4381">Rees</persName></hi><hi>, &amp; spent some time in looking over the books displayed in his shop. There is little beyond "War&#8211;books", &amp; one has got weary of these. A certain amount of theology, and some novels are coming out, but nothing worth buying, &amp; very little worth reading. I ordered a few volumes to be sent on to the Deanery, just to "pay for my standing".</hi>
