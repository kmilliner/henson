<hi>I was rather disappointed that no report of my sermon appeared in the "</hi><hi rend="underline">Times</hi><hi>"; &amp; a mere snippet in the "</hi><hi rend="underline">Morning Post</hi><hi>": and I was surprised that my letter about the summons of the <orgName xml:id="57">R.C.C.</orgName> did not appear. The papers are full of the notable achievement of the French aviators in destroying no less than six of the Zeppelins which were returning from the raid on England.

Then back to the Club, where I found </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="552">Headlam</persName></hi><hi>, &amp; had tea. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="669">Sydney Lee</persName></hi><hi> was there, &amp; very anxious to expound to me some muddling that has taken place at Oxford over the National Biography Dictionary. Then I walked back to <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName>. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="1820">Charles</persName></hi><hi> told me about the state of the Abbey Finances. The new choir&#8211;school has cost no less than &#x00A3;</hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">31,000</hi><hi>: &amp; the War has greatly reduced the takings from the fees of visitors, besides compelling an increase of all the wages.</hi>
