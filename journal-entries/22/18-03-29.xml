<hi>The morning post brought the episcopal ring presented to me by my late colleagues, the Canons of Durham. </hi><hi rend="underline">It is a replica of the ring of Bishop William of S. Barbara<persName xml:id="4193"></persName>, preserved among the treasures of Durham</hi><hi>. I attended Mattins, and heard a sermon from the <persName xml:id="3741">Dean</persName>. Then I sate through the </hi><hi rend="underline">Three Hours Service</hi><hi>" from 12 noon to 3 p.m. It was conducted by Canon R. <persName xml:id="4461">Wylde</persName>, &amp; was not (so far as my own experience permits a judgment) very edifying. In order to occupy my mind I read the first 79 psalms. It surprised me to find how well they harmonized with the occasion. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="4158">Carden</persName> joined us at a kind of premature "high tea" after the service. We walked back with her to her cottage, &amp; then returned to the Close. We went into the Palace garden, which has a woefully neglected appearance. Then I wrote to all the Durham Canons thanking them for the ring.</hi>
