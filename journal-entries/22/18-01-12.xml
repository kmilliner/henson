<hi>"My own feeling,</hi> <hi rend="underline">qu&#x00E2;</hi><hi> journalist, is that the public at large are becoming slightly bored by the discussion, but that they will be overwhelmingly on the side of Henson if the higher authorities were in any sense to make a martyr of him."</hi>

<hi>It is , however, not the "public at large" which really counts in the affairs of the Church, but that small, fanatical "religious" public, whose tastes &amp; ideals are expressed by the "religious" press.</hi>

<hi>Bishop <persName xml:id="3694">Mercer</persName> wrote to me in kindly terms. Episcopal letters are now important. I have now received no less than 45 but of these at least 7 must be marked as doubtful, &amp; of the remaining 38, I doubt whether many represent any genuine sentiment of support for me and what I stand for. I wrote to the <persName xml:id="4450">Archdeacon of Hereford</persName> saying that I hoped to carry through the programme of confirmations arranged.</hi>
