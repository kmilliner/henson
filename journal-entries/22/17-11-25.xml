<hi>A comparatively calm morning followed the hurricane of yesterday, and with the wind has fallen also the temperature. I dressed in full view of a ruddy sun&#8211;rising, which mingled with its beauty an element of menace. Then I went to the exquisite little Norman church in order to receive the Holy Communion. Nothing could be more solemn &amp; devotional than this little old sanctuary. It is horrible to reflect that the day may be at hand when the age&#8211;long witness of its worship shall cease, and it shall be vacant to the tourist, or even suffered to crumble &amp; fall.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">My "post" included a letter from </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="636">Ernest</persName></hi><hi rend="italic"> in which he expresses nervousness about my appearance on the platform next week! "The question of your promotion is at its most critical point &amp; it is quite vital that you should confine yourself to broad principles &amp; not attack persons". </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">How is it possible for any self&#8211;respecting man not to plunge into "blazing indiscretions", when that kind of consideration is suggested to him?</hi>

<hi>At Mattins I preached &amp; read the Lessons. My sermon was that which I wrote originally, as a supplement to the "City <orgName xml:id="37">Temple</orgName>" discourses, on "The failure of Lutheranism, no disproof of the Reformation". The little church seemed to be quite full, and the congregation was very attentive: but whether they could have been anywise edified appears to me something more than doubtful. Mine host expressed himself as pleased with the sermon, &amp;, indeed, I can imagine that it might interest a man versed in history. Nor can it be denied that the 400</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> anniversary of the Reformation (for it is agreed to take the nailing up of Luther's 95 Theses, Nov: 1</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi><hi> 1517, as the Birthday of that movement) ought to be sufficiently interesting to English Churchmen to justify making it the subject of a sermon in Nov: 1917. Still, I fear, "there was not gospel enough the sermon to save a tom&#8211;tit"!!</hi>

<hi>After lunch I wrote my weekly letter to <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName>. We walked out in the afternoon, &amp; had tea with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><persName xml:id="4443"><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Wicksteed</hi></persName><hi>, the brother of the <persName xml:id="4444">Unitarian minister</persName>, where we met old </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><persName xml:id="4339"><hi rend="doubleunderline"> Mozley</hi></persName><hi>, the father of the <persName xml:id="4338">Pembroke fellow</persName>, &amp; his daughter </hi><persName xml:id="4483"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Miss Mozley</hi></persName><hi>, who has been a nurse in Serbia. We went into Leeds. </hi><persName xml:id="3587"><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3587">Draper</persName></hi></persName><hi> preached in the parish church, &amp; I "sate under" him. He has a good voice, but an ungraceful action, &amp; his discourse was rather involved. We had supper with the new Vicar of Leeds, </hi><persName xml:id="4274"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Heywood</hi></persName><hi>. His <persName xml:id="4275">brother</persName>, a member of the <orgName xml:id="57">R.C.C.</orgName>, declared his agreement with my action respecting the Church &amp; State Report. The weather had become bitterly cold. We noticed ice in the roads as we walked home.</hi>
