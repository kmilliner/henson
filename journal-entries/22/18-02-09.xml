<hi>I walked to the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName>, &amp; there revised the sermon for the <orgName xml:id="37">Temple</orgName>. <persName xml:id="225">Bernard</persName> was there, and I asked his opinion on one or two passages. That opinion rather reflected the prudence of an archbishop than the courage of a confessor! Then I prepared notes for a sermon tonight in Barking. Also I wrote to Harold. <persName xml:id="322">Buckle</persName> came in and was very conversational. I called on Macmillans, &amp; ascertained that my MS. had arrived, and that they w</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> approve the inclusion of <note xml:id="421" n="1">my letter</note> to <persName xml:id="166">Ingram</persName> about the City Temple preaching. On returning to the club, I wrote to Ingram asking permission to publish his letter. The <persName xml:id="784">Speaker</persName> came in to the dining room while I was lunching, and told me that he was week&#8211;ending at <placeName xml:id="82">Chequers</placeName> to see the house. I walked back to the Deanery, &amp; joined <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>. We went to Barking, and there I preached in S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Paul's Church on the 25</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> anniversary of its foundation. It was my first episcopal sermon; not unfitly preached in my first parish.<note xml:id="380" n="1"></note> </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I took for my text the words, "Jesus Christ is the same: yesterday, &amp; today, yea &amp; for ever"</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> <hi>Quite a number of old friends shook hands with me after the service, &amp; seemed really glad to see me. The Vicar, <persName xml:id="3580">Pelham</persName>, seems earnest and sensible. He accompanied us to the station. We returned by the electric railway to Blackfriars, arriving back at the Deanery about 9 p.m.</hi>
