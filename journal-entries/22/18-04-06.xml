<hi>Rain fell heavily most of the morning, but the weather improved during the afternoon, &amp; the evening was fine. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> <persName xml:id="4441">Whiteside</persName> called by appointment, and I offered him the living of Bredwardine with Brobury. He said that his decision would turn on the size of the Vicarage! In the afternoon, <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I attended the meeting of the governors of the Herefordshire County Hospital. The business was formal. We went to the Palace, &amp; resumed our labours there. My books are in a weird &amp; inextricable confusion. Two sectaries, the Rev</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> John Thomas, General Secretary Forward Movement of the Presbyterian Church of Wales, together with a local Sectary, came to see me about what they called a "National Day of Prayer". I was civil enough, but promised nothing!</hi>
