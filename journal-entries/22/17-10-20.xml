<hi>I left Durham by the early express, &amp; travelled comfortably to London. Last night there was a raid with Zeppelins. A bomb fell in Piccadilly Circus and did damage both to life &amp; property. I drove to <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName> and deposited my bags in 4 Little Cloisters. Then I walked to the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName>, &amp; spent the time there until 5 p.m. </hi><persName xml:id="1820"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Charles</hi></persName><hi> was in the Club.
