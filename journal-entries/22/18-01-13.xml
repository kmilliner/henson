<hi>It is evident that the enemy is busily at work, but, perhaps, the fact that a petition to the Archbishop is being signed argues a consciousness that nothing effective can be done at my Confirmation. The "Spectator" has some justly severe observations on the circulation of a leaflet in the diocese of Hereford inviting prayer against my consecration, &amp; suggesting the collect for S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Matthias' Day as a suitable prayer!</hi><note xml:id="365" n="1"></note> <hi rend="bold underline">I suppose there will be many petitions signed in the churches today after appropriate discourses</hi><hi rend="bold">!</hi>

<hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName></hi><hi> re&#8211;appeared after a month's absence. He came to see me, and read most of the letters from bishops which have come to me. He had not realized the possible developments of the agitation against my Consecration. We discussed the chances of the appointment to this Deanery. <persName xml:id="552">Headlam</persName> and <persName xml:id="308">Hobhouse</persName> appear to be the two likeliest candidates, &amp; of these the last is said to lead. But I incline to think that Headlam would make the better Dean. He would stand up for the Foundation against these Church Reformers, &amp; make a good fight.</hi>
