<hi>I celebrated in the Cathedral at 8 a.m. After breakfast D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Patterson<persName xml:id="4893" display="no"></persName> gave me my second injection. Then I wrote to the Lord Chancellor<persName xml:id="2508"></persName> urging him to transfer Nelson<persName xml:id="4341"></persName> from Leominster to Rookhope. Is this a case of 'doing evil that good may come'? or, Is it more truly described as an attempt to remedy a mistake viz: the mistake of placing a 'round' man in a 'square' hole? There came to lunch M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Day, &amp; Lady Lucas Tooth<persName xml:id="4617"></persName>. The latter tells me that she must leave Holm Lacy, &amp; that the property will again be offered for sale. The great houses are becoming empty, &amp; threaten to become uninhabitable, for the heavy taxes, and the difficulty of obtaining domestic servants are making their occupation extremely difficult except for the wealthiest people.</hi>

<hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="3619">Bannister</persName> came to see me. He showed me a type&#8211;written circular from the "Life &amp; Liberty" committee, signed "W. Temple<persName xml:id="1173"></persName>", which had been sent to him as the Secretary of the Diocesan Conference. It urged that, in view of the action of the R.C.C. resolutions in favour of "Self&#8211;government" should be introduced into the Dioc: Conf. Thus is "public opinion" manufactured.</hi>

<hi>I preached at S. Martin's. <persName xml:id="3618">Lilley</persName> &amp; Riddell<persName xml:id="4840"></persName> accompanied me. There was a considerable congregation. The church is odious from every point of view. My sermon was a failure, &amp; the people took out their resentment in coughing!!</hi>
