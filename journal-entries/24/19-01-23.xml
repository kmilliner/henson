<hi>I motored to Burwarton, and there lunched with the Rector, M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Parker<persName xml:id="4647"></persName>, with whom was <persName xml:id="3618">Lilley</persName>. After lunch we motored to Chetton, where we were met at the parish church by the vicar, M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Southwell<persName xml:id="4683"></persName>. With this man I had grave talk, for not only has been bankrupt twice over, but he is ill&#8211;reported of in the neighbourhood. I told him of his ill repute, &amp; warned him that, if he did not reform his ways, I would certainly take action. He took all this very meekly, a circumstance which assured me of the truth of the evil rumours about him. After visiting Glazeley, we returned to Burwarton &amp; had tea. Then we motored back to Hereford, where I went through my letters with <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName>. Mainly a wasted day!</hi>
