<hi>I did nothing but write letters, among which one to the Bishop of Norwich<persName xml:id="1816"></persName>, of which <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> made a copy, as I thought it might prove to be important.

<hi>Bulmer<persName xml:id="4521"></persName> came to see me about forming an association to "stir up" Hereford on the subject of social reform. I said I would join in heartily if the said association were on a really broad basis. The man seems to me rather suspiciously oleaginous, but mainly I think what he says is sound. Certainly the present Chairman of the C. [County] Council (Corner<persName xml:id="4745"></persName>) does not inspire confidence. </hi>
