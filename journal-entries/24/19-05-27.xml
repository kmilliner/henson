<hi>My dear Lord Archbishop,</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I had hoped to hear from you, and, as the carriage of letters has hardly yet recovered its former security, I think it advisable to prevent the possibility of misunderstanding by writing again.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>On March 26</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi><hi> last, I sent you a letter in which I set forth the reasons why I thought it important that my lectures sh</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> be postponed until the autumn of next year, viz: Sept&#8211;Oct. 1920: and I begged for your opinion on the point.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I assume that your silence implies your approval of my own view, &amp; that you will expect me to lecture </hi><hi rend="underline">next year</hi><hi> as I desire.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>I enclosed a brief sketch of the lectures wh. I propose to give: and, when you can find the requisite leisure, I shall be grateful if you can tell me whether it accords with your wishes. I need not add that I shall value any suggestions you may be pleased to make.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>Most sincerely yours,</hi>
         </p>
