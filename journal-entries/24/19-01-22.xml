<hi>I worked at the Temple sermon, very vacuity: &amp; was much interrupted by callers. Llewelyn<persName xml:id="4309"></persName>, a queer little quarrelsome Welshman, now Vicar of Clodock, came to lunch. He is at loggerheads with the adjacent parish over burial&#8211;rights in Clodock graveyard. I attended a meeting of the representatives of female workers in the diocese, &amp; said a few words: and then I sawed wood for two hours. Old Prebendary Duncombe<persName xml:id="4756"></persName> came to tea, &amp; told me some of his recollections. He was ordained by Bishop Hampden<persName xml:id="4768"></persName>, who was "hodden down" by a virago&#8211;wife, who was the original of M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Proudie in Trollope's novel.</hi>

<hi><persName xml:id="3618">Lilley</persName> brought me a cutting from "the Examiner" a Roman Catholic paper circulating in India. It contained the following:&#8211;</hi>

<hi>"No less than eleven clergymen from the Diocese of Bishop Hensley Henson have made their obedience to Rome, &amp; this is regarded as the outcome of </hi><hi rend="underline">a man who is an avowed disbeliever in the Divinity of Our Lord and other fundamental doctrines of Christianity, being raised to the episcopal bench</hi><hi>. In addition to all these clergymen, numbers of the laity are also </hi><hi rend="bold">[55] </hi><hi> being received daily, and again particularly in Bishop Henson's diocese".</hi>
         </p>

         <p>
<hi>Neither <persName xml:id="3618">Lilley</persName> nor <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName> had ever heard of so many as one clergyman being 'received' into the Roman Church; &amp; I certainly have never heard of any. If this paragraph be a specimen of Roman "intelligence", it "gives one to think furiously". But it is futile to correct such lies. For with the advantage of a lead, they can never be overtaken.</hi>
