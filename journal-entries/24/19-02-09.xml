<hi>A most glorious day, but very cold. I preached in the Cathedral at Mattins on the League of Nations: and afterwards I celebrated the Holy Communion. My voice was in a bad state, &amp;, though I exerted myself to the utmost, I doubt if I was well heard. In the afternoon I addressed an assembly of men in All Saints Church on "Reconstruction". There was a good congregation, &amp; it was (I think) interested. My address lasted a full half hour. In the course of it I read the letter which appeared in the "Times" of last Monday under the heading "The Rhine &amp; the Clyde â€“ a Contrast". Returning to the Palace, I prepared for another departure tomorrow!</hi>
