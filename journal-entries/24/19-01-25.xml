<hi>I worked at the Preface for the 'Naked Truth'<ref xml:id="1026"></ref>. If only I had time &amp; leisure I could do a good piece of editing: as it is. I shall expose myself to hostile and well&#8211;merited criticism. We motored to a place 4 miles beyond Leominster, &amp; there lunched with Major Ward Jackson<persName xml:id="4873"></persName> who has just been elected as M.P. for North Herefordshire. He is good looking, intelligent, &amp; optimistic. We made two other calls, &amp; then returned to the Palace where I sawed wood for an hour, &amp; then did my letters with <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName>. The weather today has been most miserable, wet, gloomy, and depressing, good neither for soul nor for body.</hi>
