<hi rend="italic">I wrote a letter of remonstrance to the Dean about yesterday's incident.</hi><hi> Then the doctor came, &amp; gave me leave to travel. I went to Paddington by the 9.55 a.m., arriving at 3.25 p.m. Despairing of a taxi, I proceeded by the Tube to Trafalgar Square, and so reached Garlant's Hotel.

There were few people in the Club, &amp; nobody whom I cared to talk with.</hi>
