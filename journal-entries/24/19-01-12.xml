<hi>I celebrated the Holy Communion at 8 a.m. in the Cathedral: &amp; then remained in my study writing letters &amp; preparing notes. After lunch <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I motored to Ludlow, where I gave an address at a "United Thanksgiving service" in the Town Hall. We had tea with the Rector<persName xml:id="4602"></persName>, &amp; then attended Evensong in the glorious parish church, when I preached. There was a considerable, but not a crowded, congregation. The service was sung by the "Preacher", the Rev. G. A. Hale, whose attitude was, perhaps, lacking in a due deference. He has recently returned from serving as a chaplain abroad, &amp; may be somewhat lifted up! We motored home through a bright moon&#8211;light. On either side of the road for some miles before we reached Leominster, as we came from Hereford, the meadows were submerged, so that the country had the appearance of a large lake. The morning post brought a pencilled letter from Michell Peirce, the young Canadian, whom I picked up one morning in the Bailey at Durham, and gave lunch to. He has written to me now &amp; again, generally omitting to give an address! Now he writes from the Canadian General Hospital in France. I wrote to him forthwith. Also, I wrote to my Brothers, Arthur<persName xml:id="3128"></persName> and Gilbert<persName xml:id="1095"></persName>, both of whom are "down in their luck", the first with a sick wife<persName xml:id="3192"></persName>, the last with a lack of employment!</hi>
