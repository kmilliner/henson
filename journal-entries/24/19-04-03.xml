<hi rend="italic bold underline">Sir Richard gave a very interesting account of his experiences as a prisoner in Germany</hi><hi rend="italic">. On the whole, though there had been brutal doctors and nurses, he thought the mass of these officials had behaved fairly well. The English officers used the German bread as fuel, and were punished with 48 hours of solitary confinement, but this they did not much object to as it enabled them to get out of the stifling atmosphere of their place of detention. Besides, they could open the doors of the cells, and smuggle in cigarettes. The digging of the tunnel through which many of the prisoners escaped was a wonderful performance. German officials were as stupid as they were brutal, and seem to have been easily outwitted. He thought that there was really a shortage of food in Germany, and that this explained much of the privation to which the British prisoners were exposed. On the whole I received the impression that the case against the Germans had been exaggerated: &amp; so far I am pleased, for it was painful &amp; in a sense degrading to be forced to credit the horrible accusations which have been so extensively circulated. The good name of human nature is an interest common to all nations. It cannot be sacrificed in Germany without inflicting moral impoverishment on England. We need to guard what is left of our self&#8211;respect.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">I administered confirmation to 50 candidates in Alberbury Church. The parson, Roberts<persName xml:id="4899"></persName>, came to lunch, &amp; took occasion to tell me much of his woes. He says that he w</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic"> like to exchange to a sphere where he had some educated parishioners. The 'pauperes Christi' have no friends! After lunch I motored to Pontesbury, &amp; there confirmed 80 candidates. There was a fair congregation, &amp; the service seemed to be devotional. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">A whole squad of bilious&#8211;looking Dissenting ministers attended the service, &amp; poured oil on me afterwards</hi><hi rend="i bold">!</hi><hi rend="italic">It took about 3 hours to motor from Pontesbury to Hereford, a distance of about 50 miles.</hi>

<hi rend="italic">Alberbury is the native village of "old Parr<persName xml:id="4826"></persName>", whose cottage is a local curiosity. His portrait adorned the dining room of Loton Hall. On reaching the Palace I found that Reichel<persName xml:id="413"></persName> and Ernest<persName xml:id="2841"></persName> had both arrived. There was a considerable bundle of letters, but they included nothing of any great importance, or of any human interest!</hi>
