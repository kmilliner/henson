<hi>The weather had somewhat improved. We left Condover Hall<placeName xml:id="93"></placeName> at 11.30 a.m. and motored to Hereford. At Ludlow we stopped, and lunched at the Feathers. Then we continued our journey, and arrived at the Palace about 3.30 p.m. There was a considerable expanse of flood. At the entering of Leominster the water lay across the road a foot deep. Two Church Army<orgName xml:id="50"></orgName> Officers – Commissioner Shirter &amp; Capt. Neil – came to see me. Then <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName> did the letters.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi>The evening paper reports that the Railway men have refused the Government Offer. This probably means that the Miners will do the same. We are on the threshold of momentous conflicts, the issue of which is doubtful.</hi>
