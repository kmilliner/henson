<hi rend="italic bold underline">Dicey<persName xml:id="403"></persName> had some conversation with me before taking his departure</hi><hi rend="i bold">.</hi><hi rend="italic">"I suppose at the bottom of my heart I am what must be called a Unitarian" he said: and that is probably where he stands theologically, but it is with Martineau<persName xml:id="4808"></persName> rather than with Carpenter<persName xml:id="4732"></persName>. "May God bless you!" he said with considerable feeling as we bade farewell in the porch. I think the old man enjoyed his visit, &amp; that he has a genuine affection for me, a sentiment which I reciprocate. Miss Anson<persName xml:id="302"></persName> &amp; her sister expressed their thanks for my labour on the Memoir<ref xml:id="996"></ref>. I shall indeed be thankful when </hi><hi rend="italic underline">that</hi><hi rend="italic"> is </hi><hi rend="italic underline">off</hi><hi rend="italic"> my hands.</hi>

<hi>James<persName xml:id="4292"></persName> came and assisted me to fill up my income tax returns â€“ a performance which daunts &amp; puzzles me. I went to the Club, &amp; read the magazines.</hi> <hi rend="italic">Rather to my surprise Glazebrook<persName xml:id="4234"></persName> in the </hi><hi rend="italic underline">Quarterly</hi><hi rend="italic"> has an article supporting the "Life &amp; Liberty" movement<ref xml:id="1044" display="no"></ref>. He represents these absurd Radicals who are captivated by the appearance of "democracy" which this precious scheme of self&#8211;government has. Also I read Ralph's extremely brilliant article in the "Edinburgh" on "The Future of the Anglo&#8211;Saxons"<ref xml:id="1045"></ref>. It is almost uncannily clever, &amp; makes one feel more cynically helpless than ever.</hi>
