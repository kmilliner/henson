<hi><persName xml:id="3618">Lilley</persName> and I made a start in the car for Church Stretton, but abandoned the road at Leominster because the driving snow rendered progress both difficult and slow. After waiting for half&#8211;an&#8211;hour on the bleak railway platform, we took train to Church Stretton, and arrived about 2 p.m. After lunch we went to the Church Institute, &amp; held our meeting. Only six clergy attended besides ourselves, but the weather was prohibitive. I spoke about the Selborne<persName xml:id="311"></persName> Scheme, &amp; invited frank discussion, but nobody had anything to say. Then we went back to Prebendary Auden's<persName xml:id="4500"></persName> house, &amp; waited till there was a train to carry us back to Hereford, where we arrived about 9 p.m. very cold. In fact I was chilled to the bone, &amp; felt miserable.</hi>
