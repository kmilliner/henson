<hi>I went to a hair&#8211;dresser, &amp; had my hair cut. Then I walked out to "The Orchard", and called on Dicey<persName xml:id="403"></persName>, who received me with much kindness, &amp; talked with great volubility on many subjects. He </hi><hi rend="bold underline">was evidently pleased with the result of the General Election, and had no sympathy with Asquith<persName xml:id="215"></persName> in his defeat. Herein he seemed to shew himself lacking in generosity</hi><hi rend="bold">. I</hi><hi> returned to All Souls for lunch, after which we took our departure. After changing at Reading, &amp; waiting there for nearly an hour, </hi><hi rend="bold underline">we got to Gloucester</hi><hi>, arriving about Â½ an hour after time.</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">We were kindly received by the Gees<persName xml:id="2920"><persName xml:id="3484"></persName></persName> at the Bell Inn, where they are still living as the Deanery is not yet ready for their occupation</hi><hi rend="i bold">.</hi><hi rend="italic">The Bell Hotel has a certain interest, for it once numbered George Whitfield<persName xml:id="4702"></persName> among its waiters! It is now a large hostelry of the familiar commercial type. A note from the Bishop was awaiting me. It contained an invitation to dinner. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">In these days no notion of conviviality, hardly a suggestion of hospitality, attaches to an episcopal entertainment. There is no wine, &amp; the company consists of diocesan officials and holy women of one sort or another</hi><hi rend="i bold">!</hi>
