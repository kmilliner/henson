<hi rend="italic">Willie Murray<persName xml:id="227"></persName> sends me a series of papers which have been sent to him by the "Parliamentary C</hi><hi rend="i sup u">tee</hi><hi rend="italic"> on Church &amp; State". There is (1) A pamphlet publ</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic">. By S.P.C.K. giving a summary of the Archbishops' C</hi><hi rend="i sup u">tee</hi><hi rend="italic"> on Church &amp; State. (2) A printed list of "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Members of the H. of C. on [sic] Parliamentary C</hi><hi rend="i sup u">tee</hi><hi rend="italic underline"> on Church &amp; State</hi><hi rend="italic">". The Chairman is Sir Robert Williams<persName xml:id="1552"></persName> M.P. and the list contains 171 names. It includes Labour men e.g. Galbraith<persName xml:id="3868"></persName> &amp; Ben Tillett<persName xml:id="4863"></persName>, Protagonists of Protestantism like Joynson&#8211;Hicks<persName xml:id="4295"></persName> &amp; Sir R. Williams, &amp; all the Cecilians . (3) </hi><hi rend="italic underline">A type&#8211;written Appeal to the Scottish Members dated 26 March 1919, and signed by Robert Williams, Chairman, Ed</hi><hi rend="i sup u">w</hi><hi rend="italic underline"> Beauchamp<persName xml:id="4719"></persName>, T. W. Inskip<persName xml:id="4783"></persName>, Joseph Nall<persName xml:id="4821"></persName>, Rob</hi><hi rend="i sup u">t</hi><hi rend="italic underline"> Newman<persName xml:id="4823"></persName>, W.

Birchall<persName xml:id="4723"></persName>, Wolmer<persName xml:id="1028"></persName>, Secretaries</hi><hi rend="italic">. It invokes "their sympathy &amp; interest in support of the C. of E. Enabling Bill"<note xml:id="451" n="1"></note> which "is shortly to be introduced into the H. of Lords by the Abp. of C<persName xml:id="128"></persName>". It declares "The C</hi><hi rend="i sup u">tee</hi><hi rend="italic"> includes members of all denominations &amp; of all parties, as this is not a party question nor is it one that affects the C. of E. alone. The movement can command the support of all those who desire to assist in the purification of a part of the Christian Church, to pave the way for Reunion, &amp; to promote the spiritual welfare of the Nation". It invites the members from Scotland to attend the next</hi><hi rend="bold">[117]</hi><hi rend="italic">meeting of the C</hi><hi rend="i sup u">tee</hi><hi rend="italic"> on April 2</hi><hi rend="i sup u">nd</hi><hi rend="italic">. I was sufficiently moved by this information to write a letter to the "Times" headed "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Scotticising the English Church</hi><hi rend="italic">".</hi>

<hi>I corrected and returned to Mes</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">sr</hi><hi> Chatto &amp; Windus the proof of the Introduction to "The Naked Truth"<ref xml:id="1026"></ref>. It is printed in the same type as the pamphlet. This is a mistake.</hi>

<hi>The old deaf Countess who is <persName xml:id="112">Ella's</persName> connection lunched here, but I could nowise make her understand my speech! I wrote to Linetta<persName xml:id="1255"></persName> bidding her goodbye before she leaves for Italy on "All Fools Day".</hi>

<hi rend="italic bold underline">Yesterday's "Times" included the text of a "Memorial to the Archbishops" advocating confirmation at an earlier age</hi><hi rend="i bold">.</hi><hi rend="italic"> It is sent by "The Federation of Catholic Priests" and is signed by D</hi><hi rend="i sup u">r</hi><hi rend="italic"> Darwell Stone<persName xml:id="4414"></persName> as Chairman, &amp; Rev. F. Underhill<persName xml:id="4868"></persName>, Secretary. It describes the Federation as "a society now numbering some 600 priests of the C. of E. &amp; formed for mutual support in the defence &amp; furtherance of Catholic Faith &amp; Order". The document is rather truculent after the manner of our new "Catholicks". I should judge that these 600 constitute the Romanizing party &amp; that, if they would take themselves off to their true home, there might possibly by peace in the Church. But they will not go: the impurity of their anarchy is too good to be sacrificed to conscience or to consistency!</hi>
