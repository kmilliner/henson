<hi>The irruption of long&#8211;winded parsons, obsessed with their own tiresome troubles, &amp; set on fire with impossible aspirations, is a sore burden for a bishop to bear. Scarcely had I got rid of <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName> and <persName xml:id="3618">Lilley</persName>, than I was invaded by the Rev</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi><hi> E. H. Harrison<persName xml:id="4772"></persName>, Rector of Ullingsworth [Ullingswick], who came to tell me that he wanted another living on the grounds of his own ill&#8211;heath, and the impossibility of educating his boy! He has no means, and has continued 14 year in his present parish. The patron of Ullingsworth is the Bishop of Birmingham<persName xml:id="421"></persName>. Now what conceivable advantage could he suppose would come to him to set against the trouble of coming into Hereford, &amp; the folly of provoking the Bishop's resentment by wasting his Lordship's invaluable time?</hi>

         <p>
<hi>I wrote to Archbishop S&#x00F6;derblom<persName xml:id="2166"></persName> proposing the 3 weeks from September 21</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">st</hi><hi> for the 8 lectures on Anglicanism, which I promised before the War to deliver in Upsala; and I suggested as an alternative course that I should postpone my visit until the summer of 1920. Then I sawed wood for an hour.</hi>

<hi>After lunch a lady, Miss Gaw, called with the purpose of inducing me to support anti&#8211;tuberculosis efforts in Hereford. I made a vague promise. Then I went off to Brogyntyn, Oswestry, to stay the night with Lord Harlech<persName xml:id="4825"></persName>, previous to the function in Shrewsbury tomorrow. The weather was wet and suicidal.</hi>
