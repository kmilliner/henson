<hi>M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Gratton<persName xml:id="4766"></persName> went off after breakfast. I gave him a copy of "Notes of my Ministry". The Archdeacon<persName xml:id="4450"></persName> left soon after, and then I settled to work on the Preface to "The Naked Truth"<ref xml:id="1026"></ref>. Then I went to the Cathedral, &amp; instituted three clergymen viz: Fortescue<persName xml:id="4760"></persName> to Leysters, Talbot<persName xml:id="4859"></persName> to Middleton Scriven, &amp; Griffiths<persName xml:id="4910"></persName> to S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Mary Clee. It appears that my victim of yesterday is named Croft. He is a respectable jobbing gardener, &amp; is known to James<persName xml:id="4292"></persName>. He does not seem to have received any serious injury. After lunch I sawed wood, and then resumed work on the Preface, until I was interrupted by a visit from <persName xml:id="3619">Bannister</persName>. Then <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName> came to do the letters, &amp; then it was time for dinner. So the days slip away in petty activities, &amp; nothing is done â€“ a 'hand&#8211;to&#8211;mouth' existence unworthy of an intelligent &amp; educated man!</hi> <hi rend="italic">I received the first notice of the meeting of the Lambeth Conference next summer. On the whole I regret the meeting. It may mean some very unpleasant experiences for me, for some of the colonial bishops are said to be bent on clearing the church from the stigma of my heresies! The preliminary list of subjects covers a vast expanse of debateable territory!</hi>
