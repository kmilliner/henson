<hi rend="italic">I walked to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, &amp; spent the morning I writing a letter to the "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Times</hi><hi rend="italic">", in which the gist of my intended speech in Convocation was set forth. This I shewed to Gow<persName xml:id="216"></persName>, and to Pearce<persName xml:id="636"></persName>: &amp; since they approved it, I sent it to Printing House Square by the hand of <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName> who turned up opportunely in the course of the afternoon.
