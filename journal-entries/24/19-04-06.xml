<hi>William<persName xml:id="4501"></persName> is reported to be ill with an attack of influenza. However, another man was sent from the Garage, who drove me to Cradley, where I confirmed 23 persons. The parson, Prebendary Janvrin<persName xml:id="4785"></persName>, was formerly Vicar of S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Peter's in Hereford. The church is modern, but the tower is ancient &amp; very interesting â€“ a Norman shell encasing a Saxon wattle &amp; daub building. From Cradley I went on to Ledbury where I lunched with the Vicar<persName xml:id="4525"></persName>, &amp; then confirmed 96 persons in the glorious parish church. On returning to Hereford I went to S</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi><hi> Martin's, and instituted <persName xml:id="4506">Beattie</persName> to that Vicarage. <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName>, as Rural Dean, inducted him.
