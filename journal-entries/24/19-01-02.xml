<hi>The weather had become fine during the night, and was fine throughout the day. We spent the morning in viewing the Deanery, which is in the hands of the workmen. The house is full of historical associations, but not well placed for sun, &amp; not very convenient domestically. We lunched in the hotel, and afterwards left Gloucester for Hereford, where we arrived about 4 p.m. I found a considerable pile of letters awaiting me. </hi>
