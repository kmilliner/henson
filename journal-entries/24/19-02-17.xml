<hi rend="italic bold underline">I wrote a second article for the "Times" calling for a Royal Commission.

<hi>I presided over a meeting of "Bible &amp; Prayer&#8211;book" examiners. There were four of them – Davies, Lushington<persName xml:id="4312"></persName>, Haseler, &amp; Carlton<persName xml:id="4847"></persName> – and they stayed to lunch. </hi><hi rend="bold underline">I inquired of them how far their parishioners were interested in the recent election of the House of Laymen; and without exception they replied that their people had no knowledge of any election having taken place</hi><hi rend="bold">!</hi><hi> I believe that would be true of all the rural districts, &amp; probably also of the urban districts also. Outside the tiny coteries of ecclesiastical agitators, nobody has the smallest interest in this mighty movement for ecclesiastical autonomy. After these good folk had taken their departure, I sawed wood for an hour: and, later, went through my letters with <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName>. After dinner I read the "Cambridge Modern History" to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>. We are picking out the history of Sweden, with a hazy notion that we may perhaps go there in the autumn.</hi>
