<hi>I instituted two clergy â€“ Timmis<persName xml:id="4864"></persName> to Thruxton, &amp; Cooke<persName xml:id="4743"></persName> to Westbury. Also the new Prebendary, Morgan<persName xml:id="4819"></persName>, made his declarations. M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><persName xml:id="4560"></persName><hi> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Fielden<persName xml:id="4561"></persName> came to lunch: also M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r </hi><hi> Fortescue<persName xml:id="4760"></persName>. After lunch I had a little conference with the Vicar&#8211;designate of Kimbolton<persName xml:id="4860"></persName>, and the Vicar of Laysters as to the redivision of parochial boundaries: Then, accompanied by <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName>, I motored to Eardisland, and inspected the plans for the changes in the parish church. The parson, Birley<persName xml:id="4724"></persName>, shewed us the church, &amp; expounded his intentions. </hi><hi rend="italic">A piscina in the wall adjoining the squire's pew had been transformed into a book&#8211;box for the squire &amp; his family. A smart door heavily adorned with armorial bearings had been introduced, &amp; the effect was quite desecratingly handsome! </hi><hi> I received a lamentable account of the situation in the adjoining parish of Monkland, &amp;, hearing that Montgomery Campbell<persName xml:id="4634"></persName> had some knowledge of the present incumbent, I motored on to Eardisley, &amp; learned what he could tell me. Then we returned to Hereford, arriving in the Palace about 7.30 p.m. I found Harold<persName xml:id="1097"></persName> had arrived from Kimnel Camp. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> took Mary<persName xml:id="4867"></persName> with the two young men to a dance in the Town Hall, while I did my best to entertain Dicey<persName xml:id="403"></persName> and the two ladies. I did not think it necessary to sit up for the dancers!</hi>
