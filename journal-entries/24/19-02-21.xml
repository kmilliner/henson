<hi>The post brought from Carlton<persName xml:id="4847"></persName> a refusal of Thruxton.

She told this story as illustrating the insensibility of the lower orders to fine feeling, &amp; the character of their humour. Travelling one day in an omnibus she noticed that the conductor &amp; the driver were not on good terms, for whenever the driver turned towards the conductor, the latter seemed to exasperate him by gently swinging his badge, which hung round his neck on a chain. She inquired at length why he did this. "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">It's to get a rise out of Bill. 'is father was 'ung. 'E ain't got no humour"</hi><hi rend="italic">! Miss Barlow averred that this actually came within her own experience. The materials of humour – the vivid paradoxes of life, &amp; its squalid surprises – are so bound into the use and wont of their life, that the poor are extraordinarily amusing without knowing it. They provide the materials for the amusement of onlookers.</hi>
