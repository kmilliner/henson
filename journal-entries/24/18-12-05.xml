<hi>I worked at a sermon all the morning. Wright<persName xml:id="4457"></persName> and the Archdeacon<persName xml:id="4450"></persName> came to lunch, and then I went with them to a meeting of the Diocesan Finance Board. When this was over, I walked for an hour with <persName xml:id="3618">Lilley</persName>. Then I prepared notes from the MS, of the sermon which I had prepared for the evening, &amp; in due course preached from them in the cathedral. On the whole I was well pleased with the service. All the parish clergy were there, except </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName></hi><hi>, who had gone to the Bishop's<persName xml:id="475"></persName> Funeral at Clifton tomorrow, &amp; </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Treherne</hi><persName xml:id="4426"></persName><hi> who seems always to isolate himself from his brethren. There was a considerable congregation, which was certainly attentive &amp;, I hope, interested. Influenza and the Election are not favourable to the "assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is".</hi>
