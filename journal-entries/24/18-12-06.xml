<hi rend="italic">I revised another sermon for use in Manchester next Sunday, for I am absurdly pledged to preach twice.

I suspect that he was ill&#8211;regarded by most of them, for he conflicted both with their ecclesiastical and with their political opinions. My margin of discord is smaller for I have little sympathy with Radicalism, and I think the inevitable d&#x00E9;nouement of the Labour policy is "Bolshevism" i.e. sheer anarchy. They live in an unreal world of class hatreds disguised by altruistic sentiment: they have no notion of the decisive part which sound finance plays in the affairs of nations: and they stand pledged to social &amp; economic policies which must involve the nation in bankruptcy, and then in anarchy. Nor do I see from what source any relief is to be found, for the class&#8211;suspicion has been so developed among them that they will not believe any authority, however well&#8211;informed &amp; independent which does not echo their class shibboleth</hi><hi rend="i bold">!</hi>
