<hi>I walked to Welbeck Street, and had my teeth radiographed by M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Clark. It is a curious performance, not painful but unpleasant. Then I walked to the City, and lunched with Kitty<persName xml:id="1209"></persName> and Ralph<persName xml:id="427"></persName> at the Deanery. Paula<persName xml:id="2067"></persName> was there &#8211; a quaint little creature. I dined with the Master<persName xml:id="3581"></persName> &amp; M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Barnes<persName xml:id="4717"></persName> at the Temple. Rawlinson<persName xml:id="2091"></persName>, the member for Cambridge, was there &amp; Pearce<persName xml:id="636"></persName> &amp; his sister<persName xml:id="2109" display="no"></persName>, also Ralph &amp; Kitty &#8211; a pleasant dinner. Barnes will hold on to the Mastership as long as he can. The specific statement which has appeared in the papers to the effect that he will do so "during the King's convenience" is, he assures me, wholly unofficial. The actual income of the Master is no more than &#x00A3;25 from endowment: the Benchers make it up to &#x00A3;500, and pay rates &amp; repairs. </hi>
