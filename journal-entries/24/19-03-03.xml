<hi>The Archdeacon<persName xml:id="4450"></persName> and I motored to Colwall, &amp; there discussed with D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Harris<persName xml:id="4581"></persName> the question of a resident curate for Upper Colwall. We went to the latter, &amp; admired the noble view of the Malvern Hills. Then we went to Coddington, &amp; had tea with old M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Bulkeley &amp; his wife. He agrees that it would be desirable to unite Coddington and Bosbury. As both livings are in my gift it ought not to be impossible to do this. On the return journey to Hereford, as we passed through Tupsley, the car swerving to avoid a bicycle struck an elderly man. We stopped and picked him up. He seemed more shaken than hurt, so we carried him in to D</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Morris, &amp; I sent back the car to carry him home. I have reason for thankfulness that he was not killed outright.</hi><hi rend="italic">The Rev</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic">Herbert Gratton<persName xml:id="4766"></persName>, a Baptist military chaplain, who has recently served in Mesopotamia, arrived to dine and sleep. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">He is desirous of receiving Ordination</hi><hi rend="italic"> in the Church of England, but he is 38, and has had no academic education whatever.</hi>
