<hi>After breakfast Treherne<persName xml:id="4426"></persName> and two laymen, Allen and Lambert, came to see me about S. Barnabas, the iron church in All Saints' Parish which was so sharp a thorn in the side of Bishop Percival<persName xml:id="475"></persName>. After they had taken their departure, <persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName> came to do the letters: &amp; when he had done with me, the doctor seized upon me for my good. Then an early lunch, and after that, a journey to Shrewsbury, where I presided over a meeting of the Ludlow Voluntary Schools Association. <persName xml:id="3618">Lilley</persName> gave me tea in the Club<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, and then we caught the express back to Hereford, where we arrived about 7 o'clock. I wrote a series of letters, and so ended a busy &amp; fruitless day. The weather was very cold, snow in the afternoon, &amp; then rain.</hi>
