<hi>I finished the Preface, &amp; sent it off to Mess</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi><hi> Chatto &amp; Windus. The notion of editing the Pamphlet must perforce be abandoned, &amp; I shall content myself with the more modest 'reprint'. After lunch <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I motored to Hardwick, where I took a confirmation. The day was fine, &amp; our route lay through a very lovely country. We returned by way of </hi><hi rend="bold underline">Madley</hi><hi>, where we called on M</hi><hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi><hi> Turner<persName xml:id="4691"></persName>, the parson. He shewed us the very noble parish church, dedicated (as he affirmed) to the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin. The chancel is wider than the nave, an arrangement which gives the Eastern end of the Church a very fine appearance. The eastern windows are filled with medieval glass, much of it evidently a patch work of miscellaneous pieces. There was an ample crypt under the chancel. The population of Madley is about 700 souls, and besides the great parish church, which could easily accommodate them all, there are no less than four chapels. </hi>
