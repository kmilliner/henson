<hi>The snow had not wholly disappeared, and its survival had been assisted by a frost. I asked the gardener whether the fruit prospects were endangered. He thought nothing was sufficiently advanced to take any damage. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4448">Wynne&#8211;Willson</persName></hi><hi> came to go through the letters, and then I made my dispositions for departure. We left the palace in two cabs. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; Mary Webbe<persName xml:id="4867"></persName> in one, and I with Harold &amp; Ernest<persName xml:id="2841"></persName> in the other. We travelled as far as Oxford together. There Mary &amp; Ernest got out. </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Muir Mackenzie</hi><persName xml:id="601"></persName><hi> joined us at Worcester. He had been week&#8211;ending with </hi><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Beauchamp</hi><persName xml:id="4806"></persName><hi> at Madresfield. We were distressed at his frail &amp; aged appearance. There were no porters at Paddington, but we did succeed in getting a taxi after some delay, &amp; were driven to Garland's Hotel. I walked round to the Athenaeum<orgName xml:id="89"></orgName>, where I fell in with Sir Richard Harrington<persName xml:id="4771"></persName> &amp; Radcliffe<persName xml:id="4657"></persName>. I took up the "</hi><hi rend="underline">Church Times</hi><hi>" &amp; read a review of the volume in which my King's College Lecture appears. It is hostile but less virulent than I had thought probable. </hi><hi rend="italic">The "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">Times</hi><hi rend="italic">" has a short letter from </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Temple</hi><persName xml:id="1173"></persName><hi rend="italic">disclaiming any connexion with the "Challenge", which seems to have definitely committed itself to Disestablishment.</hi>
