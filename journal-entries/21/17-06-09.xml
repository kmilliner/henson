I followed by a later train, George carrying my bag to the station. Of course I missed the connexion for Hexham, as the train arrived 20 minutes late in Newcastle, but we did finally meet at the house of the Rector of Hexham, <persName xml:id="3167">Canon Savage</persName>. He has but recently returned from Salonika, of which he gives a depressing account. The health conditions are the worst in the world, and the topographical features of the country appear to be so difficult as to make any military progress impossible.	</p>
