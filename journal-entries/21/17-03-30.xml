         <p>The day started in cloud &amp; rain, but it soon cleared, &amp; finally grew into a splendid day. We spent it well. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, <persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName>, and I set out after breakfast, and visited the old parish church of Eastbourne, a fine building with many interesting features. Nowhere else have I seen a piscina on the south wall at the level of the rood&#8211;loft. Presumably there must have been an altar on the rood loft in the pre&#8211;Reformation days. The late&#8211;Norman chancel arch makes a noble appearance in the Church. Leaving the Church we climbed to the top of the hill, and obtained a noble prospect of sea &amp; land. In the afternoon <hi rend="bold underline">we attended a lecture on Italy by </hi><hi rend="bold doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="4114">Richard Bagot</persName></hi>. It was interesting, but contributed no new facts to the sum of our knowledge. He trod "delicately" when referring to the action &amp; influence of the Roman Church.</p>
