         <p>The morning is brilliant after the rain, the atmosphere warm but no longer sultry. Last night the chapel appears to have been flooded. The down&#8211;fall for a short time must have been almost tropical. Before breakfast I wrote a long letter to <persName xml:id="2841">Ernest</persName>. <hi rend="italic bold underline">The keeping up correspondence with the boys at the front is a sacred duty, but it consumes a vast amount of time and mental stuff.</hi> Now that the German submarines have made the security of the post doubtful, one is disposed to grudge this expenditure of one's vital resources! </p>
         <p>I attended Mattins, &amp; afterwards settled down to the <persName xml:id="228">Memoir</persName> until lunch. Then I worked in the garden until tea&#8211;time, after which I returned to the <ref xml:id="996">Memoir</ref>. Byron Dolphin called after dinner to ask me to make a short speech at the performance in Birtley. Then I read some more of <persName xml:id="118">Creighton's</persName> <ref xml:id="854">"Papacy"</ref> to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>. <hi rend="underline">Voila tout!</hi>
