         <p>A young parson named <hi rend="doubleunderline">Williamson</hi> addressed me in the street with the words: "You often gave me orders for the Choir at Westminster while I was at school"; &amp; added a request that he might see the Kitchen at the Deanery. I had just time to shew it to him before going to Mattins. In the afternoon I went to Pittington by train, &amp; thence walked to Ramside being met on the way by <persName xml:id="2837"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Pemberton</hi></persName> and his friend. We had tea in the garden very pleasantly, and then I walked back to the Deanery, a distance of rather more than 3 miles. The weather has been fine, &amp; harvesting proceeds more hopefully. If present conditions are maintained for the next fortnight the final verdict on the English harvest will not be unfavourable.</p>
