         <p>About midday snow began to fall again, &amp; continued falling until night&#8211;fall. I celebrated Holy Communion at 8 a.m., and attended both Mattins &amp; Evensong. My main business was the preparation of notes for the men's service in Leeds tomorrow. I have but the haziest notion what is expected of me, but I assume that hymns &amp; the address form the main part of the proceedings. The severe weather makes exercise out of doors impossible. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I walked for an hour in the great Library. It was better than nothing. I wrote to <persName xml:id="77">Marion</persName>. The morning post brought me a long letter from <persName xml:id="2841">Ernest</persName>, giving a detailed account of the journey from the camp at Abergele to Salonica. He is evidently enjoying his experiences, &amp; taking note of everything he sees. His mind is receptive &amp; eager: he has an almost childish eagerness to communicate his feelings &amp; impressions: he writes with ardour &amp; simplicity. </p>
