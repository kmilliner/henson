         <p>A heavy snow&#8211;fall threatening our route to the north! April comes in scurvily "as a lion". The "<hi rend="underline">Times</hi>" is filled with the most appalling descriptions of German savagery. No conceivable iniquity is omitted from the record of wanton &amp; senseless outrage. In order to cut away the last extenuating plea, the facts are set forth in the German newspapers with hideous glee, &amp; in repulsive detail. What can be said for such a nation? The snow fell steadily until lunch&#8211;time. I stayed indoors, and wrote a number of letters. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Bridget Tallents</hi> came to see us after lunch. We left London by the 5.30 p.m. express, and travelled (3<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi> class) without serious discomfort to Durham, which we found deep in snow. <hi rend="bold underline">So ended a jaunt from home in which the Rubicon was crossed in matters ecclesiastical</hi>.</p>
