         <p>I wrote to <persName xml:id="302">Miss Anson</persName> suggesting that an effort should be made to get the <persName xml:id="228">Warden's</persName> letters to <persName xml:id="1171">Raper</persName>: and to <persName xml:id="4230">Prof. Geldart</persName>, asking for an estimate of the quality of his work as a law&#8211;teacher, &amp; writer of law&#8211;books. Also I wrote to <persName xml:id="645">Sir Courtenay Ilbert</persName> asking for his reminiscences of the Warden, who was his pupil. </p>
         <p>I attended Mattins and Evensong: &amp; worked at the <ref xml:id="996">Memoir</ref> all the morning. After Evensong I walked to Dryburn, &amp; had tea with <persName xml:id="3813">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Darwin</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="3981">Gilbert</persName>. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> joined us after a while. The weather, which had been blustering and at intervals wet, became fine towards the evening.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="1170">The Master of Balliol</persName> responded very generously to my appeal for help: if his deeds are as good as his words, I ought to get some material for the Memoir from him. After dinner I wrote to him, to <persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName>, and to <persName xml:id="77">Marion</persName>.</p>
