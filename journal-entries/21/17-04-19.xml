         <p>The weather was mild, and even warm, though somewhat blustering. I went to Newcastle after breakfast in order to see the dentist, and with him I spent great part of the morning. He sawed off the broken tooth, &amp; fastened on a porcelain substitute most marvellously. On my way to the place of torment I fell in with <persName xml:id="3096">Judge Greenwell</persName>, with whom I discussed the question of the <orgName xml:id="227">Sherburn</orgName> Chairmanship. I told him that in my opinion the new Chairman ought to be a layman, &amp; also one who had acquaintance with the business of the Hospital. This would practically limit the choice to one of the three â€“ <persName xml:id="2837">Pemberton</persName>, <persName xml:id="1659">Burdon</persName>, &amp; himself. For my part I should be equally content with any of them. <hi rend="bold underline">I objected to the <persName xml:id="590">Archdeacon</persName> as working "with so large a margin of irritation", &amp; also because he was fundamentally untrustworthy. He agreed with this view of Watkins</hi><hi rend="bold">.</hi> On returning to Durham, I attended Evensong, &amp; afterwards read some more of the <persName xml:id="228">Warden's</persName> Journal, &amp; wrote some necessary letters.</p>
