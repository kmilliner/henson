         <p>I did not get up for the early service as I had undertaken to celebrate after Mattins. Mine host himself brought me tea &amp; shaving water. I suspect that he also cleaned my boots himself! <hi rend="bold underline">The exquisite little Norman church of Adel</hi> looked its best in the sunlight. There was a fair congregation including some of the superior class (merchants &amp; professors of the University) who reside in the parish. The service was reverent &amp; hearty. I preached on "Calamity, the Mother of Superstition", &amp; was well listened to. Also I celebrated the Holy Communion, at which about a dozen or fourteen people communicated. After lunch, feeling unusually fatigued, I retired to my room, &amp; rested. <hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="4394">Sadler</persName> came to tea. He is very keen about the Russian Revolution</hi>, &amp; says that it was all arranged last summer. On the whole, the change is thought to be favourable to the Allies. I went in to Leeds, and <hi rend="bold underline">preached at Evensong in the parish church</hi>. There was a great congregation. My sermon was that which I originally preached in Windsor Castle on "Jeremiah's golden sword". I returned to Adel for supper, &amp; went to bed very tired. An unusual circumstance marked my visit to Adel, &#8211; <hi rend="bold underline">an owl laid an egg in the vestry. The Rector produced it at breakfast, &amp; speculated on the portentous significance of the bird!</hi>
