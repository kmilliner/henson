         <p>Bright sun, &amp; keen east wind. I wrote a letter to the "<hi rend="underline">Newcastle Daily Journal</hi>" with reference to the vote of the Lower House of the Canterbury Convocation in favour of re&#8211;inserting the name of Charles I in the Calendar.<note xml:id="347" n="1"></note> Then I wrote to <persName xml:id="1018">Curzon</persName> thanking him for the <persName xml:id="228">Anson</persName> letters, and to <persName xml:id="2068">Lord Cobham</persName>, asking him to write something about the Etonian activities of the Warden: &amp; to <persName xml:id="1082">Fawkes</persName>, explaining why he w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> probably be benefitted by my support of his candidature for S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Olave's. After lunch I laboured on the potato&#8211;patch, which is now finished as far as the planting stage is concerned. <hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="2809">Freeman</persName> was good enough to declare that I had proved myself to be no "paper Dean"</hi><hi rend="bold">!</hi> On returning to the Deanery, I found <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName> entertaining two Belgian officers, who c<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> speak as much English as I can French, which is little enough. However, we went round the Cathedral, &amp; then I handed them over to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> for a visit to the Castle. Scarcely had I settled down to writing a letter in my study before <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName> appeared, &amp; held me in talk until dinner. Afterwards I read a really remarkable letter written by <persName xml:id="4286"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Huxley</hi></persName> to <persName xml:id="3629"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Kingsley</hi></persName>. The excellent canon had seized the opportunity of the death of Huxley's son &#8211; a child of four &#8211; in order to offer as persuasive an argument for immortality as he could, &amp; Huxley had been moved to a frank expression of his own position. The letter fills six pages of the 'Life', and is a notable exposition of the Agnostic's point of view. (v. "Life &amp; Letters[^"^]. vol I. p. 313&#8211;320) <hi rend="italic">I read the "</hi><ref xml:id="954"><hi rend="italic underline">History of the Papacy</hi></ref><hi rend="italic">" aloud to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>. We finished the history of the Council of Constance. Surely that Council was the greatest &amp; most significant failure, which Christian history records. Yet the notion which holds the minds of Bishop </hi><persName xml:id="49"><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Gore</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> and his followers appears to be essentially identical with that which determined the assembling of the Council; &amp; certainly no modern exponent can vie in learning &amp; ability with Gerson &amp; D'Ailly. I suspect that the Council's treatment of Huss is not more remote from the treatment which our "Catholicks" would extend to those whom they are pleased to regard as hereticks, troublesome folk like the Dean of Durham for example!<note xml:id="395" n="2"></note></hi>
