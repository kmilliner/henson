         <p>A fine soaking rain, which in ordinary years w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> help crops, but now only hinder planting. In the "Times" of yesterday, that humourless divine (a born prig if ever there was one) <hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="2688">Horton</persName></hi> has a letter on the question of Sunday labour on the fields in which he suggests that the <hi rend="bold underline">lateness of Spring is a Divine chastisement for our essays in Sabbath&#8211;breaking</hi><hi rend="bold">!</hi> I presided at a meeting of Chapter, and secured the passing of a resolution directing <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="648">Car&#x00F6;e</persName> to prepare a scheme for replacing statues in the Neville screen, removing the chancel screen, &amp; completing the choir&#8211;stalls. If we could get an intelligible statement of the project, it would facilitate operations. After attending Evensong I had an interview with <persName xml:id="4344"><hi rend="doubleunderline">M</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi> <hi rend="doubleunderline">Nimmins</hi></persName> about <hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3571">George</persName></hi>. It was as I surmised. The sole obstacle to his going to sea is the initial expenditure &#8211; six months at school, and a premium of &#x00A3;40. I offered to contribute half of the cost of the schooling &amp; to fund the premium. On that understanding, M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> N. said that he w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> make no delay in completing the arrangements. <hi rend="bold underline">Shortly afterwards </hi><hi rend="bold doubleunderline">George</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> himself appeared radiant with delight at having escaped the Bank which was the alternative to going to sea. How gracious is the joy &amp; gratitude of boys</hi><hi rend="bold">! </hi>I wrote to <persName xml:id="2253">Bishop <hi rend="doubleunderline">Brent</hi></persName> thanking him for his sermon at yesterday's function in S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> Paul's, &amp; asking him to preach here on Whitsunday. Also I sent him a copy of my correspondence with the <persName xml:id="166">Bishop of London</persName>. <hi rend="italic">I received from the Bookseller <persName xml:id="93">W. W. Jackson's</persName> <ref xml:id="951">memoirs</ref> on "</hi><hi rend="italic underline"><persName xml:id="4156">Ingram Bywater</persName></hi><hi rend="italic">", which I conjectured might serve me as a model of my <ref xml:id="996">memoir</ref> of the <persName xml:id="228">Warden</persName>. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">I wrote a short letter to the "Times" in criticism of Horton's ridiculous effusion</hi><hi rend="italic">, but when it will appear is hard to say, since I missed the evening post. It is evidently vain of me to seek the support of the Nonconformists, for no sooner do I seem to make any progress in their good opinion than I get driven into opposition by some impossible outbreak of their fanaticism. Total abstinence &amp; Sabbatarianism are two shibboleths which my tongue refuses to utter, &amp; both are clear as the apple of their eye to these sectaries.</hi>
