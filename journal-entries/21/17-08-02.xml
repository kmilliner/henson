         <p>Rain descended with more or less violence all day long. Deluges are reported from the Front. It is extraordinarily unfortunate.</p>
         <p>A letter from <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> reports that he is down with malaria in Greece. That pestiferous country is rapidly earning the reputation of Sierra Leone. I finished the sermon for Sunday, attended Mattins and Evensong, walked for an hour in the cloisters with <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName>, read the papers &amp; wrote letters.</p>
         <p>The evening paper reports that <persName xml:id="4147"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Brussiloff</hi></persName> has resigned the supreme command of the Russian armies, and been replaced by <persName xml:id="4301"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Korniloff</hi></persName>. This can hardly have any other effect than a further disintegration of the Army. <hi rend="doubleunderline">Brussiloff</hi> was the only Russian General, since the Grand Duke Michael disappeared from public view, who had the prestige of victory. <persName xml:id="4432"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Falkenhayn</hi></persName> is reported to be in command of the Turkish Armies, &amp; to have been making an inspection of the position at Gaza. <persName xml:id="4103">General <hi rend="doubleunderline">Allenby</hi>'s</persName> only son is reported among the killed at the Front. This is a sore stroke for any man to bear, &amp; will hardly strengthen him for his very difficult task of meeting so formidable an antagonist as <hi rend="doubleunderline">Falkenhayn</hi>. <persName xml:id="1915"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Belloc</hi></persName> in this week's issue of "Land &amp; Water" evidently takes a grave view of the Russian collapse. It has upset all his estimates &amp; calculations as to the course &amp; consequence of the War. </p>
