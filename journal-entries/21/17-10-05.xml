         <p>The weather was wet through most of the day, but cleared in the evening. I attended Mattins &amp; Evensong. <hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="636">Ernest Pearce</persName> arrived in the afternoon</hi> and walked with me for an hour after service. <hi rend="italic">He appears to have succeeded in re&#8211;establishing his position in Downing Street, &amp; has personal communication with <persName xml:id="234">L.G</persName>. From his account of the situation It would appear that I am being seriously considered for H: but that the <persName xml:id="128">Apb</persName>. is probably hostile. Perhaps a prudent conclusion is that nothing is likely to happen.</hi>
