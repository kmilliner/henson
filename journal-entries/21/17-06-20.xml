<hi rend="italic">Female suffrage was approved last night in the House of Commons by 385 to 55. The majority which is described as "overwhelming" numbered exactly half of the House.</hi> But clearly we must now make up our minds to accept a revolutionary proposal which four years ago seemed remote enough. I fear this is but representative of the topsy&#8211;turveydom in which this thrice&#8211;accursed war has plagued the country, &amp; the world.</p>
<p>A letter from one <persName xml:id="4034">Pulvertuft</persName> arrived this morning, it contains the statement that <persName xml:id="1170">"The Master of Balliol</persName>, <persName xml:id="1173">Temple</persName>, <persName xml:id="3611">Shepherd</persName> &amp; Co. are agitating in favour of disestablishment of the Church as the only means of gaining 'spiritual freedom'". My forecast of <persName xml:id="49">Gore's</persName> development as the Anglican <persName xml:id="2835">Chalmers</persName> is likely to be justified sooner than I expected, for these men are but his creatures.</p>
<p>A long and interesting letter from <persName xml:id="2841">Ernest</persName> reached us. He is making the most of his stay in Salonika, seeing everything &amp; gathering experiences on every hand. His Shakespeare serves him as a Bible.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic bold underline">The 'Times' contains a letter under the heading "Liberty in the Church" signed by <persName xml:id="740">Mrs Creighton</persName>, <persName xml:id="4188">A. A. David</persName>, <persName xml:id="4319">A. Mansbridge</persName>, <persName xml:id="4402">J. B. Seaton</persName>, A. L. Smith, W. Temple, A. P. Charles, <persName xml:id="4290">F. A. Iremonger</persName>, H. R. L. Sheppard. It is really another "puff" of the Queen's Hall meeting on July 16</hi><hi rend="i bold superscript underline">th</hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">, and a preliminary blast on the trumpet of Disestablishment. This letter is curious as a rebellion against the Bishops, whose authority the writers are wont to exalt with some vehemence. Now they will go forward with their agitation "with them (the Bishops) or without them". </hi><hi rend="italic">I made several attempts to answer this letter but could produce nothing which seemed to me adequate. The thunderous state of the atmosphere depressed my intelligence!</hi>         </p>
<p>A rather woe&#8211;begone letter arrived from Sapper Reggie Naughton, the Australian boy's scout, including a photograph of himself. He looks much like a scare&#8211;crow which is little to be wondered at after two years experience of the War on the Western Front.</p>
