         <p>I went to Newcastle after breakfast. On the way to the station I was joined by <persName xml:id="3553">Mead&#8211;Falkner</persName>, &amp; we travelled together. <hi rend="bold underline">He was reading a work on the Mass, as he proceeded to his office in order to organize &amp; develope the output of munitions of war</hi>! After getting my hair cut, I walked to S<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi> George's, &amp; called on <persName xml:id="3590">Canon Boot</persName>, but my labour was lost, for he was not at home. I walked back to Sydenham Terrace, &amp; lunched with <persName xml:id="3178">Hadow</persName>, who (when our meal was finished) accompanied me to the station. I reached the Cathedral too late for the beginning of Evensong: but I sate at the end of the nave, &amp; listened to it. The singing sounded very beautiful, but the prayers &amp; lessons were ill&#8211;heard.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="doubleunderline">Browne</hi> came to see me in much perturbation about the notice to leave the Choir school, which <persName xml:id="3496">Dennett</persName> had given him. He has some cause for complaint against the <persName xml:id="4407">doctor</persName>, for having written decisively to me without first subjecting him to examination. But, as I pointed out to him, while examination might be requisite for a just opinion on the actual state of his health, it might be quite superfluous for the answering of the questions which I addressed to the doctor, and which he answered in clear &amp; unmistakable terms. That there is a certain hardship caused to Brown is clear, and also that this creates a moral claim to very considerate treatment by the Dean &amp; Chapter: but beyond that point, I do not see that anything can be done. If, of course, the doctor, after examining Browne, were categorically to withdraw his letter to me, we might insist on an independent medical examination: and, if that were favourable, might (I do not think we ought) allow him to remain at the school. It would be very difficult to remove from one's mind the feeling that one was sacrificing the boys to the individual teacher, &amp; neglecting an evident duty by "taking the way of least resistance". Yet it does not seem obvious how a justification could be made out for dismissing a man for a reason which was authoritatively certified not to exist! Equity would require either a withdrawal of the dismissal, or some adequate compensation for the injury implied in it.</p>
