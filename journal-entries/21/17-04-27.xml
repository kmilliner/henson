         <p>The reports of the submarine campaign are alarming. Last week was the worst yet recorded. Official statements have ceased to be optimistic, &amp; now tend to become alarmist. It w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> seem that the advent of fine weather facilitates the work of torpedo–boats. I attended Mattins, &amp; then wrote a short sermon for use at Sacriston next Sunday afternoon. After lunch I worked on the potato patch for two hours. <hi rend="bold underline">The afternoon post brought me a notice of the union of the publishing firm Smith Elder &amp; C</hi><hi rend="bold superscript underline">o</hi><hi rend="bold underline"> with that of John Murray</hi>: also a letter from <persName xml:id="1696">Olive</persName>, who is learning to drive a motor, &amp; hopes to visit us in July. <hi rend="italic">In the "Challenge" the <persName xml:id="105">Bishop of Winchester</persName> has a letter expressing disapprobation of <persName xml:id="2099">Arthur Benson</persName> and <persName xml:id="3591">Miss Maud Royden</persName> "preaching" in the <orgName xml:id="37">City Temple</orgName>. He never mentions my name, but he succeeds in attacking me obviously enough. After dinner I read aloud to <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, <persName xml:id="118">Creighton's</persName> <ref xml:id="954">account</ref> of John XXIII's [sic] duel with the Council of Constance – an edifying episode.</hi>
