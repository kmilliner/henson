         <p>I walked to the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName>, &amp; had hardly settled there, before <persName xml:id="2107"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Herbert Fisher</hi></persName> came in. We had some conversation about his educational plans. He evidently enjoys his present work, &amp; is enthusiastic about it. I walked to Twinings and ordered a chest of tea (25 lbs) for our use, &amp; a smaller supply (7 lbs) for the household by way of experiment. Then I visited Hugh Rees, &amp; ordered some books. Then I returned to the club, &amp; lunched, sitting with <persName xml:id="213"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Athelstan Riley</hi></persName>, &amp; talking with him about Russia. He is very pessimistic. <persName xml:id="117"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Rashdall</hi></persName> came in &amp; I talked with him about Carlisle. After being shampooed, <hi rend="bold underline">I drove to 9 Ralston Street, Chelsea, &amp; visited <persName xml:id="2056">Elsie Knowling</persName>, &amp; the children. <persName xml:id="2764">Peggy</persName> is four, &amp; <persName xml:id="2799">Rex</persName> two &#8211; both are pretty &amp; healthy</hi>. Returning to the Athenaeum, I prepared notes for my speech at Queen's Hall, &amp; had an early dinner. Then I went to Queen's Hall, and presided at a meeting arranged by the <orgName xml:id="307">World's Evangelical Alliance</orgName>. There was a considerable attendance. I spoke for 20 minutes: <persName xml:id="2688"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Horton</hi></persName> was the other speaker &amp; he took for his subject, the observance of the Lord's Day. He spoke very fanatically. After the meeting was over I hastened back to the Deanery, and arrived in time to have three quarters of an hour with the <orgName xml:id="66">Brotherhood</orgName>, which had been dining there. <persName xml:id="602"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Burge</hi></persName> was one of the party. He is very melancholy about the situation in the Church. <hi rend="italic">In passing from the Club to the Strand I fell in with </hi><persName xml:id="2709"><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Geoffrey Robinson</hi></persName><hi rend="italic">, who started by saying, "</hi><hi rend="italic underline">When are they going to make you a Bishop</hi><hi rend="italic">?" &amp; proceeded to discuss the chances of my going on the Bench. I said that, if a suitable Bpk were offered to me, I sh</hi><hi rend="i sup u">d</hi><hi rend="italic"> probably accept it, but that I would pull no strings to get the offer. </hi><persName xml:id="36"><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Lord Robert Cecil</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> joined us, &amp; I congratulated him warmly on his recent speech.<note xml:id="394" n="1"></note> The "Birthday List of honours" is a long one. I wrote a letter of congratulation to </hi><persName xml:id="838"><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Col.
