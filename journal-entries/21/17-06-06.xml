         <p>I telephoned to the dentist, &amp; arranged to visit him in the afternoon. The carrying out of this pleasant project wasted much time. As I returned I found <persName xml:id="3572">Edgar Dobbie</persName> rather dejected with his exam<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi> for the King's Scholarship, and gave him <ref xml:id="924">"Kenilworth"</ref> by way of consolation. I have read through his Latin &amp; History papers. The first might have been worse: the latter was good. I dined at the Castle very pleasantly. There were present besides myself <persName xml:id="2920">Gee</persName>, <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName>, <persName xml:id="2806">Bayley</persName>, <persName xml:id="2748">Wilson</persName>, <persName xml:id="3666">Fowler</persName>, <persName xml:id="2837">Pemberton</persName>, &amp; the Examiner.</p>
