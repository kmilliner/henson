         <p>A beautiful morning grew into a warm day and a sultry afternoon ending with clouds and rain. I wrote letters most of the morning, finding time, however, to go to the post office, &amp; take out a motor car licence (&#x00A3;4.4.0), and to inspect the Banks with the <persName xml:id="2785">Bishop of Jarrow</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="2806">Bayley</persName>. I attended Evensong, &amp; then made some preparation for the Whitsuntide sermon, but the thunderous atmosphere made intellectual effort burdensome, &amp; after writing a few letters I desisted. <persName xml:id="3444">Macartney</persName> paid his official visit to the Cathedral, but I missed him save for a few minutes before Evensong. He says that Brown is growing feeble, &amp; unequal to his work. We shall have to consider pensioning him off, but until this thrice&#8211;accursed War is ended we can do nothing. The little man Payne is no longer accessible, &amp; may not survive the military service he strove to avoid!</p>
