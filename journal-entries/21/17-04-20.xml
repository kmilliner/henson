         <p>A beautiful fine day, definitely spring&#8211;like, infinitely welcome. I wrote to <persName xml:id="2841">Ernest</persName> before breakfast. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went to Newcastle, and did not return until late in the afternoon. I continued my reading of the <persName xml:id="228">Warden's</persName> journal until lunch&#8211;time. <hi rend="italic bold underline">After lunch I went to the potato&#8211;patch</hi><hi rend="italic">, and laboured there until tea&#8211;time. <persName xml:id="2809">Freeman</persName> started planting the potatoes in so much of the ground as had been prepared. After Mattins I expounded to <persName xml:id="590">Watkins</persName> my project for filling the screen with figures, &amp; removing the chancel screen. He professed approval, but his face darkened ominously, &amp; I felt sure that he would privily labour to upset the project! <persName xml:id="2107">Fisher's</persName> speech in the House of Commons last night when introducing the educational proposals of the Government is said to have been a great personal triumph. For two hours he held the attention of his audience, &amp; was much complimented in all quarters when he resumed his seat.</hi>
