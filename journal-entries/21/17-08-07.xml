         <p>An overcast but very stuffy day. I spent the morning in making preparations for our departure to Blanchland this afternoon. Also I wrote to <persName xml:id="225">Abp. Bernard</persName> and <persName xml:id="3462">Lord Durham</persName>. I attended Mattins &amp; Evensong. Then we &#8211; <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName>, <persName xml:id="2953">Hughes</persName> &amp; I &#8211; proceeded to Blanchland via Blackhill. Just as we were leaving the house <hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="3620">Greenwell's</persName> dog "Jock" entered the Deanery, and was violently attacked by â€œLogic". The noise and fury of the contending beasts was horrible. They were separated with much difficulty. The episode combined with the sultry heat must have upset my internal economy, for I was very sick on reaching Blackhill &amp; continued so at intervals during the drive of more than 10 miles to Blanchland. </hi><persName xml:id="3096">Judge Greenwell</persName> was our companion in the train as far as Lanchester. On reaching the "Crewe Arms Hotel" I went forthwith to bed.</p>
