         <p>A bright day throughout, but colder and with some wind. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went into Northumberland in order to visit <persName xml:id="4393">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Runciman</persName>. I went to Mattins, &amp; then worked at a sermon for the Harvest Festival at York Minster on October 5<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>. The Economic Committee met in the dining room at 2.30 p.m., &amp; discussed its Report. Then I walked with <persName xml:id="3178">Hadow</persName> to the station. He gives an interesting account of his visit to <persName xml:id="4488">Leverholme</persName> <hi rend="bold underline">where he has been singing Welsh songs with the <persName xml:id="234">Prime Minister</persName></hi>! At the station I was waylaid by an official who asked for a contribution to the Fund for a testimonial to the late station&#8211;master, who has been transferred to Sunderland. I gave him a pound. The new station&#8211;master is named Parker.</p>
