         <p>I left Leeds at 8.55 a.m., changed at York, where I waited about half an hour, and arrived at Durham at 11.35 a.m. The weather had become much milder during the night, and the snow only lingered in patches &amp; sunless banks. Before Evensong I invested young Kay with S. Cuthbert's cross. Lady Robinson arrived during the service. After tea, I wrote letters, among them <hi rend="bold underline">one to <persName xml:id="113">Harold Knowling</persName></hi>, and one to the <persName xml:id="4136">President of Trinity</persName>. After dinner the clocks were put forward an hour in order to introduce "summer&#8211;time".</p>
