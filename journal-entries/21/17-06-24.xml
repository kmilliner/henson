         <p>A dull morning, and yet heavy atmosphere, as if thunder yet hung about us. I wrote to <persName xml:id="1815"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Savage</hi></persName>, condoling with him on the loss of his son, which was announced yesterday. Then I read a book by a Mirfield Father named <persName xml:id="4420"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Thornton</hi></persName>, <ref xml:id="927">"Conduct &amp; the Super&#8211;natural"</ref>, which was recommended to me by <persName xml:id="427">Ralph</persName>. <hi rend="italic">The post brought me a letter from </hi><persName xml:id="1173"><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Temple,</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> &amp; another from his wife, also a ticket for the meeting on July 16</hi><hi rend="i sup u">th</hi><hi rend="italic">. The speakers are significant &#8211;</hi> <hi rend="italic bold underline"><persName xml:id="3611">Sheppard</persName>, <persName xml:id="4159">Carey</persName>, <persName xml:id="3591">Miss Maude Royden</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="4247">Alexander Paterson</persName></hi><hi rend="italic">. The last is the author of a book which had a considerable circulation some years ago <ref xml:id="928">"Across the Bridges"</ref>: it was a sympathetic and incisive description of South London, &amp; it was commended to the public by the inevitable <persName xml:id="105">Bishop of Winchester</persName>. He is now serving abroad, &amp; his presence at the meeting is subject to his getting leave home. Miss Maude Royden will hardly commend the movement to average Anglicans. </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">She is an anarchic feminist, who is now claiming the priesthood! </hi><hi rend="italic">On feminist principles her case is really quite irresistible.</hi>

         <p>I attended Mattins, and afterwards celebrated the Holy Communion. After lunch <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I motored to Darlington <hi rend="bold underline">where I gave an address at a Memorial Service arranged by the combined Friendly Societies of the district to honour those of their members who have fallen in the War</hi>. The <persName xml:id="4252">Mayor</persName> &amp; Corporation attended in state: two Dissenting ministers offered prayers, a local incumbent read a lesson: &amp; a voluntary choir performed an anthem. There was an evident resolution to keep the meeting solemn as befitted the professed occasion. The only applause was given to a soloist, who sang a rather sentimental song. A list of about 140 names of men who had fallen was read out, and the last Post was blown on the bugles. On the whole I was favourably impressed. <hi rend="bold underline">The service was held in the Cinematographic Hall, &amp; was well filled</hi>, mostly by members of the Friendly Societies. After the function we had tea with the Mayor and Mayoress. He seems rather a superior type of man, &amp; prides himself on his Library. He has the early editions of Ruskin's Works. We had a very pleasant drive back to Durham and arrived at the Deanery soon after 6.30 p.m.</p>
