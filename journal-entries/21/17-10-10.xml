         <p>A lamentably wet day. The ill&#8211;fortune in the article of weather, which has dogged the British advance at every stage, still continues: yesterday's offensive was carried through in a deluge. <persName xml:id="2768">"Dorothea"</persName> went off after Breakfast. I attended Mattins, &amp; then went into the town &amp; purchased a safety shaving apparatus, w<hi rend="superscript underline">h</hi> cost a guinea. I wrote a few pages of the sermon, &amp; tore up as many. Then <persName xml:id="4021">General Kelly</persName> &amp; Captain Alexander came to lunch; after which I shewed them over the Cathedral, and attended Evensong. Then I walked with <persName xml:id="2920">Gee</persName> for an hour. He presses me to write to the "Times", and make a public appeal to the <persName xml:id="128">Abp</persName>. against the meeting of the <orgName xml:id="57">R.C.C</orgName>. in November. This would hardly commend me to his Grace, or go far to disprove the contention of those who represent me to the <persName xml:id="234">P.M</persName>. as a man of strife &amp; contention! Nevertheless it might not be wrong or injudicious proceeding.</p>
