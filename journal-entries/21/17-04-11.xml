         <p>A tremendous snow&#8211;storm raging from the east. Very deep drifts reported from many parts of the country, &amp;, of course, the British offensive again handicapped by "very unfavourable weather". The battle&#8211;news, nevertheless, continues good: but the reports from Russia point ominously to domestic anarchy. I attended both Mattins and Evensong. <hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="3571">George</persName></hi> came, and straightened the books on my shelves, &amp; stayed to lunch. I gave him <ref xml:id="946">"Old Mortality"</ref>. I wrote a considerable number of letters, and paid a sheaf of bills. The weather became milder as the day advanced, and the sun was even warm, so that the snow had largely disappeared by nightfall.</p>
