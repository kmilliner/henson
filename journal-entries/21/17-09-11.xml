         <p>Another glorious morning. Russia would seem to be entering on a period of civil war. It will  put the Revolution to a sharp test, and either make or mar it. What part will the Church play now? <persName xml:id="4301">Korniloff</persName> made a rather ostentatious visit to a popular shrine in Moscow at the recent conference. There can hardly be any sincere acceptance of Revolutionary principles by the Russian ecclesiastics who know what they are and imply: but the parish popes are probably too ignorant to grasp them, &amp; look no higher than the chance of land&#8211;grabbing which the Revolution has brought to them as to the rest of the peasants. Is Korniloff big enough to play the r&#x00F4;le of Napoleon? </p>

<hi rend="bold underline">I received a remarkably ill&#8211;spelt letter from <persName xml:id="4384">Edward Riches</persName>, who was once my garden&#8211;boy in Barking, &amp; is now settled &amp; prospering in Australia</hi>. He has reverted to sheer phoneticism!</p>

         <p>No jesuite ever took in hand,</p>
         <p>To plant a church in barren land;</p>
         <p>Or ever thought it worth his while</p>
         <p>A Swede or Russe to reconcile.</p>
         <p> For where there is not store of wealth,</p>
         <p>Souls are not worth the charge of health.</p>
         <p>Spain and America had designs</p>
         <p>To sell the gospel for their wines,</p>
         <p>For had the Mexicans been poor,</p>
         <p>No Spaniard twice had landed on their shore.</p>
         <p>'Twas gold the catholick religion planted,</p>
         <p>Which, had they wanted gold, they still had wanted.</p>
         </div>
         <p>There is much cruel injustice to individuals in these lines, and much bitter justice to the Church. The Jesuits conspicuously illustrate both. 	      </p>

         <p>I attended Mattins &amp; Evensong: lunched with <persName xml:id="3262">Lillingston</persName> with whom were <persName xml:id="4420">Father Thornton</persName> and another parson. The afternoon post brought me a long, &amp; rather incoherent letter from M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Dibben, enclosing envelopes stamped &amp; addressed to her two sons, <persName xml:id="1486">Harry</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="1487">Sydney</persName>, who were formerly in the choir of <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>, Westminster. She wants me to write to them. After dinner I wrote to them both, also to <persName xml:id="3571">George</persName>, and <persName xml:id="1204">Mary Radford</persName>.</p>
