         <p>I succeeded, after many attempts, in completing a letter to the 'Times' on "Liberty &amp; the Church", and sent it off by the midday post. It is mainly a protest against doing anything during the War, but <hi rend="bold underline">raises the question of a Royal Commission on Church &amp; State after the War</hi>. I attended Mattins &amp; Evensong: also an adjourned Committee of Chapter on our coal supplies. Old <persName xml:id="4244">Haisman</persName> attended, &amp; protested himself able to undertake the filling of our cellars. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> and I walked round to the school after Evensong, and had tea. I had some talk with <persName xml:id="4219">Ferens</persName>, and looked on at the cricket for half an hour. Then I wrote to <persName xml:id="76">Carissima</persName>, &amp; prepared some notes for tomorrow's speech. M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> James came to dinner. He is a school master, ordained a year ago, and now on the staff of the Durham School. She is a Scotchwoman, who has lived in India, &amp; in a small way is literary. Neither of them made any considerable impression. He was insignificant, &amp; she was prosy.</p>
