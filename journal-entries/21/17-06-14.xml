         <p>A destructive air raid on London is reported. The clamour for "reprisals" will become more insistent. It does raise a casuistic question of some difficulty, though I am inwardly persuaded that nothing but sophistry can justify approval of mere tit&#8211;for&#8211;tat outrages, apart from any military reason. I received the Holy Communion in S. Gregory's Chapel. <persName xml:id="3496">Dennett</persName> was the celebrant, and troubled me by some new displays of ceremonialism. I attended Mattins, &amp; afterwards spent an hour with <persName xml:id="302">Miss Anson</persName> discussing the <persName xml:id="228">Warden's</persName> "Life". <persName xml:id="2798">Mr Dolphin</persName> came to lunch. I attended Evensong, after which <persName xml:id="3571">George</persName> came to consider the letter from <persName xml:id="3655">Mr Holt</persName> which arrived this morning. I wrote to say that if the Holt's would take George later, he would decline the sailing ship's proposal. After tea, we all walked for an hour &amp; then <persName xml:id="3830">Mayor Lowe</persName> came to dinner. His son, Ralph, has been gassed in the recent action. </p>
