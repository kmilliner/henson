         <p>A pouring wet day. We packed before breakfast, &amp; went back to London afterwards. On the way <hi rend="bold underline">I read the "Church Times", which contains a rather venomous leader on the Dean of Durham</hi>. On arriving at Victoria, <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> went on with the luggage to 49 Warwick Square, and I walked to the <orgName xml:id="89">Athenaeum</orgName>. Here I found <hi rend="doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="208">Beeching</persName></hi>, and lunched. After lunch I wrote a letter to the "<hi rend="underline">Record</hi>", under the heading "Exchange of Pulpits". The "<hi rend="underline">Guardian</hi>" has a temperately worded, but hostile, leader: and a truncated report of my sermon. <hi rend="italic">The earlier portion of the discourse is omitted altogether, amounting perhaps to as much as one third of the whole. I walked from the Club to Warwick Square, asking my way several times. </hi><persName xml:id="912"><hi rend="italic">M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">r</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> &amp; </hi><persName xml:id="4418"><hi rend="italic">M</hi><hi rend="i sup u">rs</hi> <hi rend="i doubleunderline">Tallents</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> were at home when I arrived, and we talked pleasantly together until it was time to dress for dinner. </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">Miss Mowbray</hi><hi rend="italic">, the sister of </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline"><persName xml:id="771">Sir Robert Mowbray</persName></hi><hi rend="italic">, came to dine.
