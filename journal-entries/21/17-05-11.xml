         <p>This day has been spent in services, meetings, &amp; letter writing, broken up by meals &amp; talk. <persName xml:id="552">Arthur Headlam</persName> brought a cousin from New Zealand to lunch. I attended a meeting of the Durham Committee of the <orgName xml:id="299">Albert Home for the Feeble&#8211;minded</orgName> a meeting of the Barry Trustees, &amp; a meeting in the Town Hall on Food Economy. The latter was addressed by an Irish lady of extraordinary fluency, who represented the Food Controller. <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> rashly invited her to the Deanery. She dined with us &amp; talked violently until 11 p.m. when I escorted her back to the County Hotel. I called on <persName xml:id="2692">Budworth</persName> about the case of the chorister, <persName xml:id="3572">Dobbie</persName>, who will stand for a King's Scholarship under the special arrangement which we agreed upon two years ago.</p>
