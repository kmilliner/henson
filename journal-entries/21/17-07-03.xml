         <p>I frittered away the day in making notes for a sermon on Friendship which I meditate preaching to the boys at Eton on July 15<hi rend="superscript underline">th</hi>. I lunched with the <persName xml:id="3718">High Sheriff</persName>, and proposed his health. Also, I attended Mattins &amp; Evensong; &amp; wrote at some length to the <persName xml:id="1980">Bishop of Newcastle</persName>. I dined at the Castle with <persName xml:id="2920">Gee</persName> to meet the Judges – <persName xml:id="4173">Coleridge</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="4325">M<hi rend="superscript underline">c</hi>Cardie</persName>. There was much &amp; interesting conversation. <hi rend="bold underline">Both the Judges expressed their approval of my letter to the "Times", &amp; both expressed agreement with my view that the clergy ought not to have been put outside the Military Service Act</hi>. The post brought me some anonymous &amp; abusive communications occasioned by my article in the "Sunday Pictorial" on "The War &amp; Convention"<ref xml:id="1051"></ref>. Also a letter from <persName xml:id="636">Pearce</persName>, who says that he has seen the papers about the <persName xml:id="4423">Todd</persName> case:–</p>

<hi rend="italic">"The papers in the Todd case reached this office on Saturday morning (we had no previous intimation that anything was amiss). Of course his writing to the paper was, strictly, against King's Regulations, but I have read what he wrote and can find no intrinsic fault with it.

<hi rend="doubleunderline">Lord Coleridge</hi> is a little man of a pinched dyspeptic aspect. He gives the impression of having a settled grievance against mankind which he is engaged in paying off! He expressed himself as opposed to Proportional Representation. He considered the pace of modern legislation far too slow to satisfy the demands of the working classes: &amp; would by no means set any limits to the right of asking questions in the House of Commons. In all this I found myself opposed to him. He said that there was no legal obligation for witnesses to kiss the Bible, that he was not aware of the origin of the custom, &amp; that the legislation abolishing the obligation was passed on the mistaken hypothesis of its existence. </p>
