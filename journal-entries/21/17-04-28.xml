         <p>A blustering day with relatively high temperature. I worked without a fire. The "Times" contains a letter from <persName xml:id="2688">Horton</persName> enclosing a long letter from the <persName xml:id="128">Archbishop of C</persName>. addressed to himself, but obviously designed for publication. His Grace is almost effusively polite, but the severity of his rejoinder cannot be screened by any civility. So far as I am concerned, Horton's defence consists of the feeblest verbal quibble, which is hardly worth noting, &amp; in point of fact shall be left alone. I attended Mattins, wasted another morning over the <persName xml:id="228">Anson</persName> letters, which however were interesting. After lunch I attended Evensong, &amp; walked round Houghall Wood with Logic. At tea&#8211;time <persName xml:id="4199"><hi rend="doubleunderline">Lewis Dunroche Smith</hi></persName>, (2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> Lieut. 3<hi rend="superscript underline">rd</hi> Bt<hi rend="superscript underline">n</hi> Black Watch) arrived from Ripon. I showed him the Cathedral. The <persName xml:id="2800">Precentor</persName> played in order that he should hear the organ, as he professed a fondness for music.</p>
