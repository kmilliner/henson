         <p>A most beautiful morning. The view of Lichfield Cathedral from my dressingâ€“room was so alluring as to distract me from the activities proper to my situation. After breakfast I walked with <persName xml:id="2685">Godfrey</persName> into the city, and, dropping him at the seat of local justice, I strolled round the streets, and went into the cathedral, where Mattins was proceeding. The acoustics of the building are good, for I heard the lessons clearly at the end of the nave. On my return to the house, I wrote a number of letters, including one to the <persName xml:id="242">Bishop of Manchester</persName>, answering his. Also I wrote to the <persName xml:id="120">Dean of Christ Church</persName>, &amp; the <persName xml:id="4136">President of Trinity</persName>, asking for materials on the <persName xml:id="228">Warden's</persName> career in the University &amp; in Trinity College. I received a letter &amp; photograph from <persName xml:id="1670">Reggie Woodyear</persName>, now a 2<hi rend="superscript underline">nd</hi> Lieut. in France.</p>
