         <p>I received the Holy Communion in S. Gregory's Chapel. Immediately afterwards <persName xml:id="3496">Dennett</persName> told me that Browne had secured from <persName xml:id="4407">D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Smith</persName> a complete &amp; categorical withdrawal of his letter to me: that, after examination, he c<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> find no trace of tuberculosis; &amp; that there was no reason why he sh<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> not continue in his position!! In the house I found a letter from D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Smith substantially to this effect: &amp; later Browne shewed me similar letters addressed to himself. All this casts a strange light on the professional competence of D<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Smith. <hi rend="bold underline">I shall insist on having an independent opinion on Browne's health before I acquiesce in his continuing as an assistant in the school</hi>. On this point I consulted both <persName xml:id="2785">Bishop Quirk</persName> and <persName xml:id="1898">Cruickshank</persName>. They agreed with my view.</p>
         <p>At noon I presided over a meeting of the educational Committee of the <orgName xml:id="227">Sherburn Trustees</orgName>. <persName xml:id="3585">Boutflower</persName> came to lunch. The little man is rather resentful of the new scheme for the Sherburn Trust, but I tried to persuade him to regard it as a merciful <hi rend="underline">pis aller</hi>. Later, I attended a meeting of the Theological Faculty, &amp; there wasted an hour. Cruickshank came to discuss the scheme for the Neville Screen. I suggested that France sh<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> be represented by Joan of Arc: America by the figure of Liberty: &amp; Japan by a Samurai warrior: and that the four niches above should be filled by the representatives of the "martyr&#8211;nations", viz. Belgium, Serbia, Poland, &amp; Armenia. These would stand on either side of the Christ in Judgment, to Whom they might seem to appeal for vindication against their persecutors. Their earthly champions w<hi rend="superscript underline">d</hi> be presented in the six great niches below. If ever the scheme is carried out, and a careful explanation of it is printed &amp; placed in the hands of the vergers, a most important addition to the interest of the Cathedral will have been made, &amp; the value of its didactic function considerably increased. The main objection lies in the difficulty of finding a sculptor, competent for so great a work.     </p>
